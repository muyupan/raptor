This document describes the Doxkstavarvet IC16MII Class Russian Interceptor Craft.

Doxkstavarvet IC16MII Class Russian Interceptor Craft 16M. A modern patrol boat is used to perform a number of different duties. In addition to surveillance and border operations, anti-drug trafficking, environmental protection, and more intense personal threat situations are areas requiring increased efforts. This requires vessels with versatile capabilities. Extreme speed and maneuverability, as well as good loading capacity and crew comfort for longer missions, are important requirements. The IC16M all-aluminum interceptor craft, developed from the CB 90 with Swedish Navy support, has low resistance despite carrying impressive loads, including many troops and weapons.

The sound-insulated wheelhouse offers excellent visibility around the horizon, and there is space for comfortable accommodation to maximize endurance, especially during longer missions. The combination of low radar profile, extreme speed, and maneuverability creates a powerful platform for police/security operations.

The crafts low draft, together with a V-shaped hull, provides outstanding performance in shallow waters as well as good sea-keeping characteristics in open seas.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Mexico, Poland, Russian Federation.
