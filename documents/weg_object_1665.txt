This document describes the 1L269E Krasukha-2 Russian 8x8 Mobile Electronic Warfare (EW) System.

The 1L269 Krasukha-2 is ground-based electronic warfare (EW) system intended to neutralize Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) by jamming its radar at ranges of up to 250 kilometers. Besides, the Krasukha-2 can provide protection to ground forces on the march by jamming any airborne radar, radar-guided weapon system or radar-guided missile. The missiles jammed by the 1L269 are unable to reach their intended target because they are provided with a false target away from the real one. The false target is finally hit by the jammed missile or weapon system. The Russian Armed Forces use the 1L269 Krasuha-2 to protect the Iskander tactical ballistic missile units. The KRET corporation produces this EW system integrated onto a tactical truck system. The 1L269 Krasukha-2 is mounted on a BAZ-6909 Special Wheeled Chassis.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the 1L269E Krasukha-2 Russian 8x8 Mobile Electronic Warfare (EW) System:
The 1RL257 Krasukha-4 is The Krasukha-4 broadband multifunctional jamming station is mounted on a BAZ-6910-022 four-axle-chassis. Like the Krasukha-2, the Krasukha-4 counters AWACS and other airborne radar systems. The Krasukha-4 has the range to effectively disrupting low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and can cause permanent damage to targeted radio-electronic devices. Ground based radars are also a viable target for the Krasukha-4.
