This document describes the Type YW-531H (Type 85) Chinese Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The Type YW-531H (Type 85) Chinese Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) is an enlarged successor to the Type 69 that has spawned a family of variants including infantry fighting, command, mortar carriers, weapons carriers, and ambulance vehicles. It was developed in parallel with the 6 x 6 Type 86 and shares the engine and most of the armament options.

Type 85 is also designated the YW 531H. Another version, designated Type 89 by China, but called the YW 534 in the People's Liberation Army (PLA), is very similar, but is 74mm wider and has 150 mm more length of track on the ground.

All vehicles in the line share a common hull. The hull has a shallow glacis, angular sides and top, track skirts over the three return rollers per side, and five wheel stations per side versus the four of the earlier Type 69.

The driver sits in the left front of the hull with the compartment for the license-built Deutz diesel engine to his right. Behind him is the commander.

Some variants have turrets, which are located over the troop compartment. The basic APCs have a shielded 12.7mm machine gun. Other main guns include 25- and 73-mm cannons. Troops enter and leave by a rear door that opens to the right; emergency roof hatches are also provided.

The number of vision blocks and firing ports varies, having three to four periscopes and firing ports on the right-hand side, and two to three on the left side. (Thai YWH 534s have three on each side and one in the rear door.)

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, China, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Zimbabwe.
