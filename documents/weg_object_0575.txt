This document describes the PLZ-83 (Type 83) Chinese 152mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The PLZ-83 (Type 83) Chinese 152mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH) is capable of firing all standard types of 152mm rounds. The main armament cannon is based on the Chinese 152mm towed Type 66 mounted on a vehicle hull similar to the Russian 152mm SP gun-howitzer 2S3. The crew communicates with each other using the Type 803 intercom system. There are reports of Type 83 being equipped with an anti-tank rocket launcher referred to as the Type 40. However, it is suspected that the rocket launcher is really the 40mm anti-tank rocket launcher Type 69-1 (an upgraded variant of the Russian RPG-7). Variants of this system are based on Type 66, a Chinese copy of the D-20 howitzer 425mm mine-clearing rocket launcher Type 462: a 2-round rocket launcher for use in clearing minefields. 120mm SP anti-tank gun: the AT gun is fitted with a 120mm smoothbore, mounted inside a turret on Type 83 gun-howitzer chassis 
 
Other ammunition types: HE-I, illumination, smoke

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the PLZ-83 (Type 83) Chinese 152mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH):
The Type 89 Multiple Launch Rocket System is Type 89 multiple launch rocket system. It is based on the same tracked armored chassis. This artillery rocket system was revealed in 1999. It is speculated that this system entered service in the late 1990s and was not offered for export. It replaced in service the ageing Type 70 130 mm artillery rocket systems..
The 425-mm mine-clearing system is This is a basic vehicle with a limited-traverse launcher that has two cradles, each holding a large rocket with a range of 875-1,090 yds (800-1,000 m). When the rocket lands, it explodes -- clearing an area 140 yds (130 m) long by 13-24 yds (12-22 m) wide.
The mine-clearance vehicle's combat weight is 59,525 lb (27,000 kg); it is is 23 ft 6 in (7.16 m) long and 10 ft 6 in (3.20 m) tall. Its launcher elevation range is -5 degrees to 45 degrees; traverse is 90 degrees to each side. The vehicle has a crew of five. The mine-clearing rocket weighs 1,675 lb (760 kg) and the warhead -- which is 15 ft 5 in (4.70 m) long -- accounts for 1,320 lb (600 kg) of that total weight..
The Type 89 Tank Destroyer is The Type 89 is a tank destroyer based on the hull of the Type 83. It features a 120-mm smoothbore anti-tank gun in a new turret..
The Trench Digger is A trench digger has been developed based on the hull of the Type 83 self-propelled howitzer. The vehicle, fitted with a front-mounted dozer blade, can dig between 8,830 cubic ft (250 cubic m) to 10,590 cubic ft (300 cubic m) of earth per hour using a digging machine carried over the rear of the hull. A crew of three operates the digger from a raised cab at the front of the vehicle.

The trench digger has a combat weight of 66,140 lb (30,000 kg). The vehicle is no longer offered for export by NORINCO..
