This document describes the PCL-09 Chinese 122mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The Chinese Army has followed the global shift and embraced the concept of a lighter, more mobile ground force. This is showcased by the adoption of such battlefield elements as the PCL-09, a 6x6 wheeled, self-propelled, artillery-carrying vehicle capable of delivering various warhead types at range. The system is believed to have appeared in or around 2009 and was publicly showcased in 2010 military exercises. The Chinese Army fields about six PCL-09 trucks per battery with these being assigned several accompanying support vehicles (radar director, Command Post, etc.).

Like other weapons of this kind, the PCL-09 is used as a ranged solution capable of supplying ground forces with fire support. The mobile nature of the vehicle allows the weapon to be relocated, fired, and relocated once again in short order. Prior to firing, support legs at the center of the chassis are lowered into the earth to help absorb the inherently violent recoil of such a weapon.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Cambodia, China, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Rwanda.
