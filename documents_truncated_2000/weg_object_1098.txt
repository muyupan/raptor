This document describes the Su-24 (Fencer) Russian Attack Aircraft.

The Sukhoi Su-24 (NATO reporting name: Fencer) is a supersonic, all-weather attack aircraft developed in the Soviet Union. The aircraft has a variable-sweep wing, twin engines, and a side-by-side seating arrangement for its crew of two. It was the first of the former USSR's aircraft to carry an integrated digital navigation/attack system. It remains in service with the Russian Air Force, Syrian Air Force, Ukrainian Air Force, Azerbaijan Air Force, and various air forces to which it was exported.

The Su-24 has a shoulder-mounted variable geometry wing outboard of a relatively small fixed-wing glove, swept at 69°. The wing has four sweep settings: 16° for take-off and landing, 35° and 45° for a cruise at different altitudes, and 69° for minimum aspect ratio and wing area in low-level dashes. The variable geometry wing provides excellent STOL performance, allowing a landing speed of 230 kilometers per hour (140 mph), even lower than the Sukhoi Su-17 despite substantially greater take-off weight. Its high wing loading provides a stable low-level ride and minimal gust response.

The Su-24 has two Saturn/Lyulka AL-21F-3A after-burning turbojet engines with 109.8 kN (24,700 lbs) thrust each, fed with air from two rectangular side-mounted intakes with splitter plates/boundary-layer diverters.

In early Su-24 ("Fencer A" according to NATO) aircraft these intakes had variable ramps, allowing a maximum speed of 2,320 kilometers per hour (1,440 mph), Mach 2.18, at altitude and a ceiling of 17,500 meters (57,400 ft). Because the Su-24 is used almost exclusively for low-level missions, the actuators for the variable intakes were deleted to reduce weight and maintenance. This has no effect on low-level performance, but absolute maximum speed and altitude are cut to Mach 1.35 and 11,000 meters (36,000 ft). The earliest Su-24 had a box-like rear fuselage, which was soon changed in production to a rear exhaust shroud more closely shaped around the engines in order to reduce drag. The revised aircraft also gained three side-by-side antenna fairings in the nose, a repositioned braking chute, and a new ram-air inlet at the base of the tail fin. The revised aircraft was dubbed "Fencer-B" by NATO but did not merit a new Soviet designation.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Azerbaijan, CFE Treaty, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Libya, Russian Federation, Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Ukraine.

Here is Variants information for the Su-24 (Fencer) Russian Attack Aircraft:
The S6 is An early project in the gestation of the Su-24, like a meld of the Su-7 and Su-15..
The T6-1 is The initial prototype with cropped delta wings and 4 RD-36-35 lift engines in the fuselage.
The T6-2I / T6-3I / T6-4I is Prototypes for the variable geometry Su-24 production aircraft..
The Su-24 "Fencer-A" is Limited production model tp support operational/field testing..
The Su-24 "Fencer-B" is Initial full-scale production variant for the former Soviet Union Air Force and limited export sales..
The Su-24 "Fencer-C" is Second full-scale production series that featured avionics and sensor imrpovements..
The Su-24M "Fencer-D" is This series featured the addition of inflight refueling and an expansion of attack capabilities with even more payload options. Su-24M has a 0.76 m (30 in) longer fuselage section forward of the cockpit, adding a retractable refueling probe, and a reshaped, shorter radome for the attack radar. It can be identified by the single nose probe in place of the three-part probe of earlier aircraft. A new PNS-24M inertial navigation system and digital computer were also added. A Kaira-24 laser designator/TV-optical quantum system (similar to the American Pave Tack) was fitted in a bulge in the port side of the lower fuselage, as well as Tekon track and search system (in pod), for compatibility with guided weapons, including 500 and 1,500kg laser-guided bombs and TV-guided bombs, and laser/TV-guided missiles Kh-25 and Kh-29L/T, anti-radar missiles Kh-58 and Kh-14 (AS-12 'Kegler') and Kh-59 (AS-13 'Kingbolt')/Kh-59M TV-target seeker guided missiles..
The Su-24M2 'Fencer-D' is The next modernization of Su-24M introduced in 2000 with the "Sukhoi" program and in 1999 with the "Gefest" program. The modernized planes are equipped with new equipment and systems. As a result, they get new capabilities and improved combat efficiency, including a new navigation system (SVP-24), a new weapons control system, a new HUD (ILS-31, like in Su-27SM or KAI-24), and expanding list of usable munitions (Kh-31A/P, Kh-59MK, KAB-500S). The last batch of the Sukhoi was delivered to the Russian VVS in 2009. Modernization continues with the program "Gefest". All frontline bombers Su-24 in the Central Military District received new sighting and navigation systems SVP-24 in 2013..
The Su-24MK 'Fencer-D' is The export version of the Su-24M with downgraded avionics and weapons capabilities. First flight 30 May 1987 as T-6MK, 17 May 1988 as Su-24MK. Manufactured 1988–1992, sold to Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Many Iraqi examples were evacuated to Iran..
The Su-24MR "Fencer-E" is Tactical reconnaissance variant that retains much of the Su-24M's navigation suite, including the terrain-following radar, but deletes the Orion-A attack radar, the laser/TV system, and the cannon in favor of two panoramic camera installations, 'Aist-M' ('Stork') TV camera, RDS-BO 'Shtik' ('Bayonet') side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), and 'Zima' ('Winter') infrared reconnaissance system..
The Su-24MP "Fencer-E" is Electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) variant designed to replace the Yak-28PP 'Brewer-E'. The Su-24MP has additional antennas for intelligence-gathering sensors and radar jamming, omitting the laser/TV fairing, but retaining the cannon and provision for up to four R-60 (AA-8) missiles for self-defense. Reportedly, only 10 were built..
