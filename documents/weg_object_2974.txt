This document describes the SPAS-12 Italian Shotgun .

The SPAS-12 Italian Shotgun is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 was sold to military and police users worldwide, as well as on the civilian market, and has been featured in many films, TV shows, and video games.

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its "military" designation as a combat shotgun. The SPAS-12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun, and it was named the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun. In 1990, Franchi renamed the shotgun the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, which allowed continued sales to the United States as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Malaysia, Portugal, Taiwan, Turkey, United States of America.
