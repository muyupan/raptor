This document describes the T-80B Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The T-80B is the primary production variant of the T-80 family. It is an MBT that features upgrades over the basic T-80. It is primarily designed to fight tanks, self-propelled artillery, and other armored vehicles. However, it is also intended to be used in the suppression and destruction of fire systems and live forces. The T-80B has a box-shaped hull with a steep glacis and a short steep belly plate forming an angular nose. There are three driver’s vision blocks in the middle of the glacis, and six unevenly spaced roadwheels per side with torsion bar suspension. The drive sprocket is to the rear and the idler to the front. The tracks are supported by five evenly spaced return rollers. The suspension and return rollers are covered by an optional rubber or armored skirt that covers the full length of the hull and reaches the top of the roadwheels. The engine is to the rear and center of the turret, and the rectangular exhaust grill is to the rear center of the vehicle with two rectangular air inlet valves on the top center of the hull behind the turret. The turret is round, and additional ERA can be added to improve protection to the front or sides. The main gun has a thermal sleeve with a central bore evacuator and a co-axial MG is installed to the right of the armament. The driver is to the front middle of the hull with a single-piece hatch, which opens up and swings to the right. The commander is seated on the right of the turret with the gunner to his left, two single-piece hatches that open to the front of the tank provide both with access.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Belarus, CFE Treaty, China, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Russian Federation, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Ukraine, Yemen.

Here is Variants information for the T-80B Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The T-80 (1976) is Initial model, with a 1,000-hp gas turbine engine, coincidence rangefinder, and no missile capability. This model does not have fittings for explosive reactive armor. The turret is from the T-64A, and thus retains the use of the old coincidence rangefinder. Characteristics of this type are the V-shaped water deflector on the front glacis, coincidence rangefinder in front of the commander's cupola, and Luna searchlight mounted in the same position as a T-64. Around 250 were produced, as the tank's armor was essentially obsolete when introduced. Turret vs APFSDS – 380 mm, hull vs APFSDS – 500 mm (without reactive armor). This was, in effect, a pre-production model. It reportedly was fitted with an early version of the Shtora APS..
The T-80BV (1985) is T-80B with explosive reactive armor Kontakt-1..
The T-80UM: is Russian version, with new Buran thermal imaging sight in place of the Luna IR..
The Object 219A: Early T-80U (Object 219AS) variant is It has the T-80U's turret, but not the Kontakt-5 ERA. Instead, it uses the old Kontakt-1/3 system; some 219As did not have ERA at all. Often misnamed T-80A. T-80U (1985): Further development with a better turret, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, improved gunsight, and 9M119 Svir missile system. In 1990 a new, 1,250-hp, engine was installed. Overall protection with Kontakt-5 against APFSDS/HEAT is 780/1,320 mm RHAe.9K119M with antitank guided missile 9M119M installed since 1990. Some of the tanks in the commander version (T-80UK) are equipped with Shtora-1 APS, and thermal imaging night sight TO1-PO2T (detection range/target classification range = 6,400/4,600 meters at night). The basic thermal night sight of the T-80U is within the limits of 1,750/1,500 meters..
The T-80UD Bereza (1987) is Ukrainian diesel version with 1,000-hp 6TD engine and remote-controlled antiaircraft machine gun..
The T-84 (1999) is Further Ukrainian development of T-80UD with 1,200-hp diesel and new welded turret..
The T-80BVD (2002): is KMDB's upgrade standard for Ukrainian T-80BVs. Changes include the 6TD diesel engine, remote-controlled commander's machine gun, and better optics. None were produced..
The T-80UM2/Black Eagle (prototype: cancelled): is Several Russian prototypes were shown at trade shows, with a longer chassis and extra pair of road wheels, and very a large turret with a separate ammunition compartment..
The T-80BVM (2017) is Up to 3,000 units, installed "Relikt" ERA, PNM Sosna-U gunner sight (as in the T-90, T-72B3), the improved 125mm gun 2A46M-4, the upgraded gas turbine engine, and the upgrades of various other systems. More than 120 are already in the service..
