Here is Variants information for the JMRC VISMOD ZSU-23-4 Shilka Russian 23mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Weapon System:
The ZSU-23-4M is The ZSU-23-4M is the 1977 model and features three (instead of two) access ports on each side of the hull and an armored cover for the guns. It also has a digital computer, improved RPK 2 radar and can be linked to off-carriage radar and fire-control equipment if required. The RPK 2 radar on the ZSU-23-4M is capable of being used independently in the search mode whereas on previous versions it had been slaved to the gun tubes..
The ZSU-23-4-M1 is Additional modernization of the radar system with modern solid-state components..
The ZSU-23-4-M2 is Upgrades to targeting equipment such as improved optics and night vision capability..
The ZSU-23-4-M3 is Version features the Luk IFF system..
The ZSU-23-4-M4 is Upgrade package replaced obsolete components with new and more efficient units and therefore extend the operational capabilities of the system as well as enhancing its overall operational capabilities. Those subsystems that have not been upgraded are overhauled before being installed on the upgraded ZSU-23-4M4 SPAAG. According to the manufacturer, the ZSU-23-4M4 features improved target tracking, increased kill probability from 0.3 to 0.6 for one fly over, the addition of man-portable SAMs and the addition of 81 mm smoke grenade launchers. It can engage aircraft and helicopters flying at an altitude from 25 to 1,500 m and aerial targets can be engaged out to a range of 2,500 m and with a speed of up to 500 m/s..
