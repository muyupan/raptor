This document describes the KMT-5 Russian Tank Mounted Mechanical Mine Clearing Device.

The KMT-5 was introduced into service to combine plough and roller breaching equipment. The KMT-4 plough system is used, but the roller design is new and lighter and has only three discs per roller section. Each KMT-5 roller sweeps approximately 800 mm. When not in use the system is carried on a KrAZ-214 (6 Ã— 6) truck fitted with a special KM-61 auxiliary crane. A chain-and-roller assembly is fitted between the roller sections to sweep the area between the tank tracks for tilt-rod mines. The roller and plough cannot be used simultaneously other than on good, flat ground. The choice of using the rollers or ploughs depends on the type of terrain, soil or minefield to be breached; it cannot be used in snow thicker than 200 mm or over loose, ploughed land. The system is fitted with a quick-release unit to allow the tank driver to disconnect both systems rapidly. The KMT-5 system can survive eight to ten 5 to 6 kg explosions; its weight is approximately 7,300 kg.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Egypt, Finland, India, Iraq, Russian Federation, Syria.
