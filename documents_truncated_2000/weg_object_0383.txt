This document describes the Hwasong-18 North Korean Intercontinental Ballistic Missile .

The Hwasong-18 North Korean Intercontinental Ballistic Missile is road-mobile and carried by a 9-axles wheeled transporter erector launcher (TEL) vehicle to support the weight and size of the missile, allowing it to traverse various types of terrain. The missile is encased in a protective canister, which is mounted in the front-middle section of the TEL. This canister also serves as the launch tube when the missile is ready to be fired. To be launched, the missile is erected in a vertical position at the rear of the TEL. The use of a road-mobile TEL increases the missile's survivability and flexibility, as it is more challenging for adversaries to locate, track, and target the missile before launch. The crew cabins are located at the front of the truck on both the right and left sides of the missile, creating a U-shape around it. It is probable that the cabin also features necessary controls for operating the vehicle, as well as communication equipment to maintain contact with command centers and other units during transportation and launch operations.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).
