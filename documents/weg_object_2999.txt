This document describes the UH-60P Black Hawk South Korean Utility Helicopter.

The story of the UH-60P Black Hawk helicopter for the Republic of Korea began in 1990 with a license agreement between Korean Air and Sikorsky Aircraft. Over the next nine years, Korean Air produced in Korea 124 of the 131 aircraft for the Republic of Korea Army. Together, the team equipped Korean industry with the expertise and technology needed for Korea to build, maintain, adapt and upgrade the UH-60P.
Now, with another 20 years left in the fleet’s service life, it’s time for the Republic of Korea to modernize the world’s most proven, multirole military helicopter for future operations. Two decades is merely the half-life of a Black Hawk helicopter – a military design known for its reliability and ease of maintenance. By selecting OEM upgrades, the Republic of Korea Army can easily operate the UH-60P fleet for another 20 years of service life.
Modernization — not a fleet replacement — is the easiest and most cost-effective approach for the Republic of Korea.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: South Korea (Republic of Korea).

The OPBH is On 11 March 2014, Sikorsky successfully conducted the first flight demonstration of their Optionally Piloted Black Hawk (OPBH), a milestone part of the company's Manned/Unmanned Resupply Aerial Lifter (MURAL) program to provide autonomous cargo delivery for the U.S. Army. The helicopter used the company's Matrix technology (software to improve features of autonomous, optionally-piloted VTOL aircraft) to perform autonomous hover and flight operations under the control of an operator using a man-portable Ground Control Station (GCS). The MURAL program is a cooperative effort between Sikorsky, the US Army Aviation Development Directorate (ADD), and the US Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UH PO). The purpose of creating an optionally-manned Black Hawk is to make the aircraft autonomously carry out resupply missions and expeditionary operations while increasing sorties and maintaining crew rest requirements and leaving pilots to focus more on sensitive operations..

The Military Specs is Korean pilots and maintainers are accustomed to the UH-60P aircraft’s broad mission versatility, high flight reliability, and ease of maintenance. That’s because the Black Hawk helicopter is built to rigorous U.S. Military standards by design, which means it’s also maintainable in the field. As a durable military aircraft, the Black Hawk performs with consistent success on the battlefield, during civil emergencies and in a multitude of roles. The switch to an all-new helicopter would involve a significant amount of unnecessary training, retooling and expense..
