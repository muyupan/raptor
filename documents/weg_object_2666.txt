This document describes the YW-531 (Type 63) Chinese Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The YW-531 (Type 63) Chinese Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) is a Chinese armored personnel carrier that entered service in the late 1960s. It was the first armored vehicle designed in China without Soviet assistance. The design is simple and is comparable to other APCs of its time such as the M113.

Approximately 8,000 all types and variants were produced by Norinco. It also equips several armies around the world and has seen action in different conflicts including the Vietnam War, the Sino-Vietnamese War, the Iranâ€“Iraq War, and the Gulf War.

The hull is made of welded steel and provides protection against small arms fire. The vehicle carries a maximum of 15 including crew, which depending on the particular configuration maybe two or four, the rest of the passengers are infantry who sit in a compartment at the rear of the vehicle. The driver sits in the front left of the hull and has a single-piece hatch, which opens to the left. The driver is provided with two-day periscopes that cover the front and right of the vehicle. One of the driver's periscopes can be replaced by a night vision device. The commander sits on the front right of the hull and has a single-piece hatch that opens to the right. The commander hatch has a periscope on the top surface that may be rotated 360 degrees. Export variants of the vehicle with BF8L engine did away with the commander's position in the front right of the hull. Behind the driver, on the left side of the hull is a third crew position, which is provided with a hatch that opens to the left, and like the commander's position has a 360-degree rotating periscope.

The engine sits to the right rear of the driver. It has a large intake located at the top of the hull, with an exhaust on the right-hand side. The engine is either a Type 6150L 260 hp diesel engine or, on export versions, an 8-cylinder air-cooled, turbocharged diesel engine KHD BF8L 413F which develops 320 horsepower at 2,500 rpm. The engine feeds a manual transmission with five forward gears and one reverse gear. The track is driven at the front by a drive sprocket and passes over four rubber-typed road wheels, then loops over an idler at the rear, before returning to the front again. No return rollers are fitted, and the track rests on the top of the road wheels. Suspension is of the torsion bar type. The vehicle has a fuel capacity of 450 liters, which gives it a broad range of around 500 kilometers.

A 12.7-millimeter caliber machine gun is located in an open mount at the front of a small hatch in the center of the hull which opens into the troop compartment. The gun can traverse 360 degrees and can be elevated to an angle of 90 degrees. Two roof hatches and a large rear door provide access to the troop compartment.

The vehicle is amphibious, a folding trim board stowed at the front of the hull needs to be raised, and the vehicle can then propel itself in the water using its tracks.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Albania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Congo, Iraq, Kurdistan, Myanmar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Viet Nam, Zimbabwe.
