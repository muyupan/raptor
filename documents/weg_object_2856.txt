This document describes the BRDM-2M-98/BRDM-2M-97 Polish Amphibious Armored Staff Car.

The wheeled armored vehicle "model 98" is a new variant of the BRDM-2. This model is very different from the basic model of the original Russian vehicle BRDM-2. The vehicle has a wide variety of improvements including a new engine, a new access hatch on each side of the sides of the hull, a spare wheel placed at the rear of the hull, a more spacious crew compartment, and better suited to current combat situations. This vehicle is currently used by the Polish army. A special effort has been made regarding the communication and navigation system. Thanks to all these improvements, the BRDM-2 has found a second youth, which still allows it a very long life in many armies of the old Warsaw Pact. Indeed, these countries do not have a significant defense budget, they are forced to find compromises to keep their armies at an operational level worthy of armies like France or the United States. There are two other variants, the "Model 97", whose turret has been completely modified. They are wider and have smoke grenade launchers on the front left and right, and also a large net holder at the rear. One can also find on the roof of the turret, an anti-tank firing post. The "Model 98" has a 12.7 mm machine gun and a 7.62 mm machine gun, a passive night vision system for the vehicle manager and the driver, and an optoelectronic recognition system. On all these vehicle models, we only find the four additional retractable wheels as on the original model. The vehicle is fully amphibious, it can move in the water at a speed of 9 to 10 km / hr.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Russian Federation.
