This document describes the D-30 (M1963) Russian 122mm Towed Howitzer.

The D-30, also known as the M1963, replaced the older 122mm howitzer M-30 (M1938). The original D-30 was fielded in 1963 and the midlife product improvements occurred in the mid to late 1970s. The original D-30 is in use in at least 50 different countries. The 2A18M, D-30A, and D-30M are midlife product improvements of the D-30 that are currently in production. The D-30 features a unique three-trail carriage, a conspicuous boxy shield for the recuperator above the tube, and a small protective shield between the wheels. The gun has a semiautomatic, vertically sliding, wedge-type breech block. It is towed muzzle-first by a truck or armored tractor, at speeds up to 80 kilometers per hour, with its trails folded under the barrel.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, Cambodia, CFE Treaty, China, Congo, Croatia, Cuba, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, Georgia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Lebanon, Libya, Madagascar, Mongolia, Montenegro, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
