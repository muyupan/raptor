This document describes the MAZ-543 Russian 8x8 Special Wheeled Chassis.

In the early 1960s, MAZ started development of an all-wheel drive chassis MAZ 543. These are the 4th generation of this family of vehicles. Its design was similar to MAZ 537G, but was fitted with new units, cabins and longer frame. The new chassis was equipped with a 525 hp D12A-525A V12 diesel, automatic transmission with an updated torque converter and a 3-speed gearbox.

MAZ 543 range included chassis MAZ 543, MAZ 543A and MAZ 543M with fiberglass side cabins. There was a place for radiator and the front part of a missile rocket between cabins. All variant had wheelbase of 7.7 meters, top speed - 60 kph and fuel consumption - 80 liters per 100 km.

The first version of the new range was a light chassis MAZ 543 with a payload of 19.1 tonnes. The first 6 prototypes were made in the spring of 1962. Mass production started in 1965. They got 2 twin-door cabins (the left and right). 1631 copies were made. They become the base chassis for a missile complex 9K71 'Temp' and missile launcher 9P117.

In 1963, MAZ 543A with a payload of 19.4 tonnes was presented. It was developed for a missile complex 9P120 'Temp-S'. Mass production started in 1966. The main difference from MAZ 543 is slightly shifted to the front both cabins. Till the middle of 2000s, more than 2600 chassis were made.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

The MAZ-7410 is MAZ-7410 is a prime mover with a shorter wheelbase, which entered production in the mid-70s.
The Wanshan WS580 is Wanshan WS580 is a Chinese heavy high mobility chassis with 8x8 configuration, which was based on the MAZ-543. Technology was transferred to China from Belarus. This Chinese vehicle evolved into a whole host of indigenous special wheeled chassis, such as Wanshan WS2400, that were carrying ballistic missiles and other military equipment. Later production models were based on Belarusian MZKT designs, but benefit from German technology transfer. These are fitted with German engines and transmissions..
