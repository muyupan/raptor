The Unimog U 4023/U 5023 makes its way.
Advancement and safety, perfection and responsibility, power and innovation â€“ those are just some of the values which Unimog customers rightfully connect with Mercedes-Benz and for which Unimog vouches. It combines great efficiency, state-of-the-art large-series production technology and outstanding off-road capability to form a truly successful overall concept that stands for Mercedes-Benz's decade-long experience in the development and production of highly off-road capable commercial vehicles.

The off-road capability of the Unimog begins with its unique chassis concept: The torsion ally flexible chassis with 3-point mounting of cab, engine and transmission as well as the axle suspension with thrust tube technology, wishbones and coil springs allow axle articulation of up to 30 degrees. All-wheel drive, single tires, Tire control plus central tire inflation system and differential locks ensure maximum off-road traction. And the vehicle's low center of gravity ensures stability even on extremely steep slopes. When off-road, the Unimog also benefits in particular from its ground clearance of up to half a meter.
