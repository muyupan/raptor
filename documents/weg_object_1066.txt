This document describes the Y-11 (Chan) Chinese Utility Aircraft.

The Harbin Y-11 (NATO reporting name Chan) is a high wing twin-engine piston utility and geological survey aircraft built by Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation (HAMC).

A requirement for a twin-engined light utility transport was issued by the Chinese government in November 1974. The Y-11 was proposed in April 1974, and the design was begun in January 1975. Design of the Y-11, under Xiong Wenjie, was completed at Harbin in June 1975 and prototype construction started immediately. The static test article completed its test cycle on 19 December 1975 and the first flight of the prototype followed soon after on 30 December 1975. Production started on 3 April 1977 with at least fifty aircraft known to have been built before production stopped in favour of the Harbin Y-12

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
