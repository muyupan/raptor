This document describes the R-381T3 Russian Automatic Data Processing Station.

R-381T3 Automatic Data Processing Station. 

The 381T3 Automatic Data Processing Station is part of the R-381T Taran Complex. 

The R-381T Taran complex consists of 7 vehicles: 1 x  R-381T3 – automatic data processing station
4 x R-381T2 – UHF radio monitoring station (30-100 MHz) 
2 x R-381T1 – VHF radio monitoring station (1.5-30 MHz), aviation radio communication monitoring (100-400 Mhz), radio relay link monitoring (300-1000 MHz) The efficient range of the complex is 40 km (100 km for aviation frequencies monitoring). Radio station detecting time is 0.3 sec. 

Another variant of the complex consist of 5 vehicles: x1 R-381T3 x2 R-381T2 x2 R-381T1 It is also possible to use separate stations.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
