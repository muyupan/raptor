This document describes the M998 HMMWV American 4x4 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle.

The High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) is the replacement vehicle for the M151 series jeeps. The HMMWV's mission is to provide a light tactical vehicle for command and control, special purpose shelter carriers, and special purpose weapons platforms throughout all areas of the modern battlefield. It is supported using the current logistics and maintenance structure established for Army wheeled vehicles. The HMMWV is equipped with a high-performance diesel engine, automatic transmission, and four-wheel drive that is air transportable and droppable from a variety of aircraft. The HMMWV can be equipped with a self-recovery winch capable of up to 6000 pounds 1:1 ratio line pull capacity and can support payloads from 2,500 - 4,400 pounds depending on the model. The HMMWV is produced in several configurations to support weapons systems; command and control systems; field ambulances; and ammunition, troop, and general cargo transport.

The M998, M998A1, M1038, and M1038A1 HMMWVs are cargo/troop carrier configurations of the HMMWV family. The vehicles are equipped with basic armor and used to transport equipment, materials, and/or personnel. The cargo carrier configuration is capable of transporting a payload (including crew) of 2,500 pounds and the troop carrier is capable of transporting a two-man crew and eight passengers. Both use a troop seat kit for troop transport operations. The cargo/troop carrier can also be configured in a four-man crew configuration. The vehicles can climb 60% slopes and traverse a side slope of up to 40% fully loaded. The vehicles can ford hard bottom water crossing up to 30 inches without a deep water fording kit and up to 60 inches with the kit. The M1038, and M1038A1 are equipped with the self-recovery winch which can also be used to recover like systems. The M998A1 and M1038A1 models have the latest modifications applied to the vehicles.
