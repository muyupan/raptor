This document describes the BS 903A Chinese Ground Surveillance Radar System.

The Chinese BS 903A is a small, lightweight modular designed ground surveillance radar (GSR) that is able to detect, identify, and locate moving ground targets using a microstrip antenna at any time of the day regardless of the season, and also in conditions of low visibility (fog, rain, snow, dust, or smoke). The GSR is produced by China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and has been in production since 2000. A low probability of intercept is achieved through frequency agility and advanced waveform ability such as continuous wave low-power transmission. The GSR is composed of two components: a tripod-mounted antenna and a display unit.
