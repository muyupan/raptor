This document describes the Yak-130 (Mitten) Russian Light Combat Aircraft.

Yak-130 (Mitten) Russian Light Combat Aircraft is a subsonic two-seat advanced jet trainer and light combat aircraft originally developed by Yakovlev and Aermacchi as the "Yak/AEM-130". It has also been marketed as a potential light attack aircraft. Development of the aircraft began in 1991 and the maiden flight was conducted on 25 April 1996. In 2002, it won a Russian government tender for training aircraft and in 2009 the aircraft entered service with the Russian Air Force. As an advanced training aircraft, the Yak-130 is able to replicate the characteristics of several 4+ generation fighters as well as the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57. It can also perform light-attack and reconnaissance duties, carrying a combat load of 3,000 kg.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Bangladesh, Belarus, CFE Treaty, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Myanmar, Russian Federation, Syria, Viet Nam.
