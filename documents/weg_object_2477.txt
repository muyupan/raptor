This document describes the 2S34 Hosta/Chosta Russian 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar.

The 2S34 "Chosta" or "Hosta" is a 120mm self-propelled mortar carrier designed and manufactured in Russia. The 2S34 was first revealed at the TVM-2014 Moscow Defense exhibition, in August 2014. The vehicle is an evolution of the Soviet-made 2S1 "Gvozdika". While the chassis stays the same as the 2S1, the main evolution is the replacement of the 122mm 2A31 series main gun by an upgrade of the 120mm 2A80 mortar gun, the 2A80-1. The 2S34 is produced by the Motovilikha Plants Corporation of Perm, in Russia, which also produces, or has produced, the 2S9 and the 2S31. In February 2014, approximately 30 2S34 are in service with the Russian army and could be in service with the 21st Mechanized Brigade, in Totskoye.

Accessories:

Standard equipment includes infra-red night vision lights (mounted at the commander's hatch) and an NBC system. 2S34, like 2S1, is fully amphibious, being propelled in the water by its tracks. Before entering the water the bilge pump is switched on, the trim vane is erected at the front of the hull, shrouds are fitted to the hull above the drive sprocket and front road wheels and water deflectors on the rear track covers are lowered. Any water that enters the hull during amphibious operations is removed via the exhaust outlet using the bilge pump. Russian sources state that the 2S1, so probably also the 2S34, takes 20 minutes to be prepared for amphibious operations.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
