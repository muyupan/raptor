Here is Missile #1 information for the Huangfeng Class Chinese Guided Missile Patrol Craft of the Missile Weapon System:
The Name is HY-2; Silkworm.

The Maximum Speed is Mach 0.8.
The Maximum Range is 200 km.
The Maximum Flight Altitude is < 20m.
The Guidance System is Inertial + active conical scanning terminal guidance radar (HY-2); or inertial + infrared homing guidance (HY-2A); or inertial + monopulse active radar (HY-2B).
The Single-Shoot Hit Probability is 90%.
The Note is The HY-2 is identical to the HY-1 but with a further stretched body. The missile features a round nose accommodating the radar seeker, a pair of mid-mounted delta wings on the middle section of missile body, and three tail control surfaces. The missile is powered by a liquid-fuel rocket motor, with a solid rocket booster attached under the missile fuselage.

The HY-2 is launched from land-based launcher and flies at an altitude of 1000 m during the initial stage of the flight. After the missile switched to the cruising mode, the flight altitude was reduced to 100 ~ 300 m. During the final stage of the flight, the missile switched on its radar seeker and dives to an altitude of 8 m until it hits the target. The single-shot hit probability is estimated to be 90%. Due to its oversized body, the HY-2 did not develop a ship-to-ship variant. The missile is obsolete and will be replaced by the YJ-8 series in the future.[3]

The HY-2 was widely exported to the Middle East, and was the missile most associated with the silkworm nickname..
