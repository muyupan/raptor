This document describes the Type 905 Class (Fuqing Class) Chinese Auxiliary Oiler Replenishment (AOR) Vessel.

The Type 905 (NATO reporting name Fuqing-class) auxiliary oiler replenishment is a class of auxiliary oiler replenishment (AOR) vessels used by the People's Liberation Army Navy and Pakistan Navy to resupply ships at sea with food, munitions, fuel and spare parts. One ship is now a commercial oil tanker in China. It is also known as Taicang class.

The Fuqing class were the first generation of replenishment oilers built by the PLA Navy for support of the Yuan Wang-class tracking ships tracking intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in the South Pacific Ocean. Dalian Shipyard produced four vessels and two of them joined the ICBM testing fleet in May 1980. The general designer and deputy general designer of ship are Zhang Wende and Huang Wei respectively, both are the general engineer of the 701st Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC).

There are a total of six transfer stations amidships, with four liquid cargo transfer stations followed by two dry cargo transfer stations. The helicopter landing pad is located at the stern, but there is no hangar. Originally designed for Harbin Z-5, the length of the landing pad was 22 metres (72 ft 2 in), but subsequently extended by an additional 5 metres (16 ft 5 in) for larger Changhe Z-8.[6] The Type 905 is capable of providing 10,550 tons of fuel, 1,000 tons of light diesel, 200 tons of fresh water, 200 tons of drinking water and 50 tons of frozen food.[5] Each liquid cargo station is equipped with a 60-metre (200 ft) long, 102 mm (4.0 in) diameter nylon hose and is capable of providing fuel at a rate of 100 to 150 tons per hour. Due to the lack of the capability to supply ammunition, Type 905 has to work in conjunction with ammunition ships such as the Yantai class to provide all the provisions needed by the combatants. The Type 905 is designed to provide liquid and dry cargos for three destroyers.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Pakistan.
