This document describes the JRTC VISMOD: DFINT-3T2 Turkish Transportable Direction Finding (DF) System.

The tri-service DFINT-3T2 system is a transportable direction finding (DF) equipment that can intercept, take a bearing on, and analyse V/UHF band communications traffic. Emitter location is achieved via collaboration with other DFINT systems (with intercommunication being by radio or landline) and, according to the contractor, the equipment can handle state-of-the-art emitter types including frequency hoppers and burst transmitters. The system can be deployed with a standard lightweight, high-gain antenna, sub-band arrays and/or a range of application specific antennas that include disguised low-profile, airborne and heliborne types. In rough terrain land-based applications, the environmentally ruggedised DFINT-3T2 equipment can be deployed by a two-man team and the system presents data in either graphical or list formats.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Turkey.
