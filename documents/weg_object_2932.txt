This document describes the Murmansk-BN Russian Long-Range Communications Jamming System.

The Murmansk-BN is a long-range communications jamming system specially designed to take out NATO and United States (US) high frequency military satellite communications. The Murmansk-BN electronic warfare (EW) system is being developed by KRET and has a maximum coverage of 3,000 kilometers (5,000 km or 8,000 km from other sources). This system was developed as part of a Russian strategic electronic warfare system and operates as a network centric capability. The primary target of the Murmansk-BN is the West's High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS). It was unveiled in November 2016 as the system prototype was achieving some test successes.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
