This document describes the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV Russian 152mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The 2S35 Koalitsiya is a self-propelled howitzer designed and manufactured in Russia by Ural Vagon Zavod (UVZ) to provide the Russian Ground Troops with its next generation of field artillery systems.  It is a successor to the 2S19 Msta-S. It is also intended to replace ageing Russian 152 mm artillery systems. Currently it is one of the most capable howitzers in the world.
The first demonstration was conducted in 2006.  It used a number of components from the previous 2S19 Msta-S.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV Russian 152mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH):
The S35-1 Koalitsiya-SV-KSh is The Koalitsiya-SV KSh is a new Russian self-propelled howitzer. It uses the ordnance of the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV, but is based on 8x8 military truck chassis. A prototype of this artillery system was ready by 2013. Public pictures of this artillery system first appeared in 2017. The Koalitsiya-SV KSh is a very capable artillery system.

   Since the early 1980s Soviets developed a 152 mm howitzer, based on an 8x8 wheeled chassis. It was known as the 2S21 Msta-K. A couple of prototypes were built, however this artillery system never reached production and the program was cancelled in 1987. It was a failure mainly because at that time Soviets had no suitable trucks to carry this howitzer, that would have sufficient payload capacity, be powerful enough and could withstand the violent recoil. The new 2S35-1 Koalitsiya-SV KSh can be seen as an evolution of the 2S21 Msta-K.

   The 2S35-1 Koalitsiya-SV KSh utilizes the unmanned turret with 152 mm ordnance of the 2S35 Koalisiya-SV self-propelled howitzer. It is based on a modified KamAZ-6560 military truck with 8x8 configuration. This artillery system can be seen as a less expensive and more mobile alternative to the tracked version. Though it looses to tracked version in terms of off-road mobility and armor protection. It is planned that this truck-mounted howitzer will be mainly used by units, that are equipped with wheeled combat vehicles, while the tracked version will be used by units equipped with tracked combat vehicles..
