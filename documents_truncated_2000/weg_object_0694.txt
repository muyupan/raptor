This document describes the C-130E Hercules American Transport Aircraft.

Introduced in August 1962, the C-130E conducted critical United States Air Force (USAF) missions during the Vietnam War through the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also supported countless USAF humanitarian efforts around the globe and in all climates.

Originally designed by Lockheed as an assault transport capable of operating from unpaved airstrips, the C-130 Hercules made its first flight in August 1954. Over the next half century, the USAF used various versions of this versatile aircraft for aeromedical evacuation, mid-air refueling of helicopters, mid-air space capsule recovery, search and rescue, reconnaissance, as a gunship, and for many other missions.

The C-130E (serial number 63-7868) on display entered service in April 1964. It had a long career, including extensive service in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War for both the USAF and Air America. Before the Vietnam War, 7868 participated in Operation Red Dragon, the deployment of Belgian paratroopers and the rescue of hostages in the Congo in November 1964. The aircraft’s last assignment was to Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas, where it was used for aircrew training.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Sweden, Turkey.
