This document describes the An-72 (Coaler) Russian Transport Aircraft.

The AN-72 is a light short takeoff and landing jet transport airplane intended for operations on non-equipped airstrips 600 m long. Powerful wing high-lift devices and improved thrust-to-weight ratio ensure the airplaneâ€™s short takeoff and landing capability. The engines installed above the wing upper surface provide lift augmentation at takeoff and landing owing to the wing and wing center section flaps upper surface blowing with the engine exhaust jets (Coanda effect). The AN-72 was serially manufactured at the Kharkiv Aircraft Manufacturing Company where 114 airplanes of this type were built between 1984 and 1992.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Libya, Russian Federation, Sudan, Ukraine.

Here is Variants information for the An-72 (Coaler) Russian Transport Aircraft:
The An-72 is Coaler-A, Pre-production aircraft. A total of eight were built, plus two flying prototypes and one static test airframe..
The An-72A is Coaler-C was an initial production aircraft..
The An-72AT is A freighter version. It is compatible with standard international shipping containers..
The An-72P is Maritime patrol aircraft. Its main role is to patrol sea cost. It is armed with 23-mm twin-barrel cannon and has underwing hardpoints for pods with unoperated rockets or 100 kg bombs. It can transport 22 paratroopers, or alternatively cargo with a maximum weight of 5 t. The first An-72P aircraft was constructed somewhere between 1983 and 1986..
The An-72PS is Search and rescue aircraft..
The An-72S is VIP transport. Its production commenced in 1987..
The An-72G is A civilian freighter aircraft. It was approved for production in 1993..
The An-71 is NATO: Madcap. It was an airborne early warning aircraft. It is based on the An-72. It made its first flight in 1975. Only 3 prototypes were built before the program was cancelled..
The An-74 is A version of the An-72, that can operate in polar regions of Arctic and Antarctica. Originally this aircraft had the designation An-74A Arktika. Modifications have been made for operation in harsh weather conditions. It could operate from low grade airstrips, such as concrete, pebble, ice and snow. It had better de-icing equipment, carried more fuel and could be fitted with wheel-skis landing gear, and some other equipment, that allowed the aircraft to operate in extreme Arctic conditions. Its maximum payload capacity was 7 500 kg. The first two aircraft were completed in 1983. Since its introduction numerous versions of this aircraft appeared. The An-74 was produced alongside the An-72. Its production still continues in Ukraine. As of 2016 a total of 76 were built, including variants. These are used both by military and civil operators..

Here is System information for the An-72 (Coaler) Russian Transport Aircraft:
The Alternate Designation(s) is An-72; NATO: Coaler-A; Nickname: Cheburashka.
The Type is Transport Aircraft.
The Manufacturer is Antonov.
The Crew is 4 (pilot, co-pilot, navigator, flight engineer).
The Passengers is 52.
The Number of Engines is 2.
The Number of Hard Points is INA.
The Payload Capacity is 10,000 kg.
The Loading Ramp is The An-72 has a hinged loading ramp at the rear..
The Landing Gear is Tricycle retractable.
The Note is The An-72 has a very unusual layout. Engines are located above the wing and are blowing over the flaps. Such design boosts lift. As a result the aircraft has 20% more lift power and improved short take-off and landing performance..
