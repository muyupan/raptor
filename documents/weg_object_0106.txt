This document describes the VN-17 Chinese Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The VN-17 is a HIFV designed by China's North Industries Corporation (Norinco) to support MBTs in front-line combat situations. It shares automotive features with the VT5 MBT and is well-armored to protect it from most threats that would ordinarily defeat an APC or IFV. It is one of the first projects where Norinco has included modularity as a design feature

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
