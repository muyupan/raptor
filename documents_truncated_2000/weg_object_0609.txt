This document describes the Type 59-1 Chinese 130mm Towed Gun.

The Type 59-I Field Gun is a licensed copy of the Soviet, Cold War-era M-46 Field Gun.  Normally had two road wheels however, two additional road wheels have been seen on some variants.  Type 59-1 is the result to improve on some of the design flaws of Type 59.  These improvements include a new carriage which is based on Type 66.  The improvement has allowed an improvement in the emplacement and displacement times.  The addition of a base plate gives the gun more stability while firing and, along with the wheels at the end of the split trails, allows the gun to be rotated thus, giving it 360 traverse ability.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, China, Myanmar.

Here is Variants information for the Type 59-1 Chinese 130mm Towed Gun:
The GM-45 is Developed by NORINCO to field a Chinese-built version of the Austrian GHN-45 gun on the many 130-mm M-46/Type 59 and 152-mm Type 66 carriages remaining in service.
The M46 carriage was adapted to ensure its recoil resistance was able to withstand the more powerful gun by:

Raising maximum elevation to +55 deg (978 mils);
Limiting maximum recoil distance to 49.2 in (1,250 mm);
modifying the GHN-45's recuperator (minimum distance is 30.5 in/775 mm);
Adopting a pneumatic rammer;
Modifying the panoramic sight and sight mount;
Changing the M-46/Type 59's breech ring and breech block to the semi-automatic screw type of the GHN-45;
Adding compressed-air supply; and
Incorporating hydraulically actuated trail-wheel raising.
Weight is 18,739 lb (8,500 kg) firing, 19,401 lb (8,800 kg) traveling; rate of elevation is 11.8 mils/revolution; rate of traverse, 11.25 mils/revolution.

Ammunition is extended-range full-bore high-explosive (ERFB), ERFB/smoke (ERFB/WP), ERFB/base-bleed (ERFB/BB) and ERFB/BB illuminating (ERFB/BB IL) projectiles. Range with ERFB is 32,808 yds (30,000 m), ERFB/BB 42,651 yds (39,000 m). ERFB/WP is 28,433 yds (26,000 m) and ERFB/BB IL is 26,247 yds (2 4,000 m).

The system is available for export.
