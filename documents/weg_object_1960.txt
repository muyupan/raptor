This document describes the SV-98 Russian 7.62mm Sniper Rifle.

The SV-98 (Snaiperskaya Vintovka Model 1998) is a Russian bolt-action sniper rifle designed by Vladimir Stronskiy. In 2003 special operations troops were armed with the 7.62 mm 6S11 sniper system comprising the SV-98 sniper rifle (index 6V10) and 7N14 sniper enhanced penetration round. The rifle has been used in combat during operations in Chechnya.

The SV-98 sniper rifle is based on the Record 300 m (328 yd) full bore sport shooting rifle series also made by Izhmash. Izhmash also produces Record target rifles chambered in .308 Winchester, 7.62×54mmR and .338 Lapua Magnum which are similar to the SV-98.

According to the manufacturer the SV-98 sniper rifle is designed to engage various targets at a range up to 1,000 m (1,100 yd).

The heart of the SV-98 is a cold-hammer-forged receiver and a cold-hammer-forged free-floating heavy barrel which can be chrome-lined to order. The manually operated bolt action has a rotating bolt with three symmetrically spaced frontal lugs. The barrel has 4 grooves right-hand rifling and a 320 mm (1 in 12.6 in) twist rate and features a threaded muzzle that can accept the standard provided conical birdcage-pattern muzzle brake or a specially designed 23db (A) suppressor that requires the use of subsonic ammunition. The rifle was developed to fire 7.62×54mmR 7N1 standard sniper, 7N14 enhanced penetration sniper or "Extra" match grade sports cartridges.

The SV-98 is equipped with iron sights (shrouded front and up to 600 m (656 yds) in 100 m (109 yds) increments adjustable tangent-type rear sight) and a Picatinny rail on top of the receiver that can be used to mount Russian and foreign-made telescopic sights and other aiming optics with an appropriate rail interface system. According to several internet sources, a standard telescopic sight used on this rifle is the PKS-07 7× fixed-magnification scope. The manufacturer however states the Russian-made 1P69 3-10×42 variable magnification telescopic sight with a sighting range of up to 1,000 m (1,094 yd) is used as standard daylight optical sight. The 1PN113 3.7× fixed magnification night sight is used as the standard low light optical sight.

The ambidextrous laminated plywood stock features an adjustable butt plate that can be regulated for the length of pull, height and pitch and has a height and length adjustable cheek comb. A fiberglass-reinforced polymer stock was also offered. A front attachment point is situated at the fore end for mounting an integral folding bipod and the stock is prepared for mounting an integral rear monopod. The length of both bipod legs is independently adjustable and the rear monopod folds into the stock. A carrying handle can be attached to the stock in order to prevent the operator from grasping the rifle by its aiming optics during quick position changes or on the march.

The trigger mechanism displays an adjustable trigger pull of 1.0 to 1.5 kgf (2.2 to 3.3 lb). The safety lever is located behind the bolt handle and the safety locks the trigger immobilizes the sear and prevents the rotary bolt from turning.

The staggered (or double) column detachable box magazine is made out of glass fiber reinforced nylon with metal inserts and holds 10 rounds. To reduce recoil, jump, flash, and sound signature, the SV-98 can be supplied with a TGP-V tactical suppressor. An anti-mirage strap can be fixed between the front and rear sights.
