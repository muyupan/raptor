This document describes the CH-4B (CH-4B Rainbow) Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The CH-4B is a mixed attack and reconnaissance system with provisions for 6 weapons and a payload of up to 250 to 345 kg.

CH-4 is capable of firing air-to-ground missile from altitude of 5,000 meters (~16,400 feet), therefore the aircraft can stay outside of effective range of most anti-aircraft guns. 

The Caihong-4, CH-4, is a long endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a battery life of 40 hours. The aircraft has been designed to perform both reconnaissance and strike missions releasing guided bombs and missiles. Externally it is similar to the very Pterosaur air vehicle with V-shaped tail, long wingspan and tail propeller but with a re-designed nose. The first pictures of this UAV appeared in 2013. The CH-4 was displayed publicly for the first time during the China Airshow in November 2014.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, China, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates.

Here is Variants information for the CH-4B (CH-4B Rainbow) Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV):
The CH-1 is CH-1 is the first of the Rainbow (CH) series UAVs. The general designer was Mr. Shi Wen (石文), who is also the general designer of CH-2, the successor of CH-1, CASC PW-1, the derivative of CH-1, and CASC PW-2, the derivative of CH-2. The CH-1 program began in 2000, and its success resulted in the establishment of the UAV program that led to other designs that followed..
The CH-2 is CH-2 is the second of the Rainbow (CH) series UAVs and is a development of the earlier CH-1, with identical twin-boom layout. As for the CH-1, propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the fuselage, and the UAV is launched via vehicle mounted catapult with rocketed assisted take-off. The CH-2 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions..
The CH-3 is CH-3 is a fixed wing unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) of the Rainbow series. The CH-3 adopts an unusual canard layout, similar to the Jetcruzer 450 and the Rutan VariEze. This means that the CH-3 lacks centrally located vertical tail, but has large winglets and canards. Propulsion is provided by a three-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted on empennage. The main landing wheels of the tricycle landing gear has fairing to reduce drag..
The CH-3A is CH-3A is the development of CH-3 and share the identical layout. Improvement of CH-3A over CH-3 includes that the maximum payload is increased to more than 100 kg, and satellite data link is also incorporated. CH3A is a multipurpose UAV which can also carry AR 1 laser guided rocket for attacking role. It is also widely rumored that Myanmar Air Force operates them, and some images have been found..
The CH-4 is Externally, CH-4 looks almost identical to General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, and the only distinct visual difference between two UAVs is that the ventral fin below the V-tail on MQ-9 is absent on CH-4. There are two versions, the CH-4A and CH-4B. The CH-4A is a reconnaissance drone (capable of a 3500–5000 km range and a 30- to 40-hour endurance) while the CH-4B is a mixed attack and reconnaissance system with provisions for 6 weapons and a payload of up to 250 to 345 kg..
The CH-5 is The CH-5 is the latest UCAV of the Rainbow series, with a wingspan of 21 meters, a payload of 1,000 kg, a maximum takeoff weight of over 3 tones, a service ceiling of 9 km, an endurance of up to 60 hours and a range of 10,000 km..
The CH-7 is The CH-7 is a stealthy flying wing UCAV similar to the X-47B, with a 22m wingspan and 10m length. It can fly at 920 km/h and at an altitude of 13,000m. Endurance is about 15 hours and its operational radius is 2000 kilometers. It can carry antiradiation missiles and standoff weapons. According to its chief designer, "the CH-7 can intercept radar electronic signals, and simultaneously detect, verify and monitor high-value targets, such as hostile command stations, missile launch sites and naval vessels". It is planned to make its maiden flight in 2019 and commence production in 2022..
The CH-10 is The CH-10 is a tilt-rotor UAV..
The CH-91 is CH-91 is a fixed-wing UAV in twin-boom layout with inverted v-tail and a pair of skids as landing gear. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the fuselage. CH-91 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. It's also called as BZK-008..
The CH-92 is CH-92 is a fixed-wing UAV in conventional layout with V-tail and tricycle landing gear. Propulsion is provided by a propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the empennage. CH-92 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions..
The CH-802 is CH-802 is a fixed wing micro air vehicle (MAV) in conventional layout with elevated high-wing configuration and V-tail. CH-802 has a cylindrical fuselage and propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven by a tractor brushless electric motor atop of the fuselage. CH-803 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions.[2] CH-802 program begun in 2007 and was completed in 2008..
The CH-803 is CH-803 is a fixed-wing UAV with a cylindrical fuselage and canards, but without tail plane. Propulsion is provided by two-blade propeller driven by a tractor engine mounted in the nose. Another unique feature of CH-803 is that it adopts forward-swept wing.[38] CH-803 is mainly intended for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. CH-803 program begun in 2008 and was completed in 2011..
The CH-901 is CH-901 is a fixed-wing UAV in conventional layout with cylindrical fuselage and high-wing configuration. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the end of empennage. CH-901 is designed as an UCAV..
