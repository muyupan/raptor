This document describes the PG99 Chinese 35mm Towed Anti-Aircraft Gun.

The PG99 is a twin barrel, low-altitude air defense weapon that is reported to be an effective part of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA's) air defense network. It was developed/licensed produced from the GDF-002 to engage low-altitude and helicopter-type targets within 4,000m slant range, or light armored targets and landing crafts. The PG99 can fire the NORINCO 35 mm Programmable Time Fuze Pre-fragmented (PTFP) round. The system consists of an anti-aircraft gun, mobile power station (40 kW), and an optional fire-control radar. The system’s reaction time to an airborne target is only 6 seconds, and the whole system can be set up or taken down within 90 seconds.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Cameroon, China.

The GDF-002 is This system is the predecessor gun that China is known to have purchased from Switzerland. China obtained a license for the old twin 35mm Oerlikon GDF series of towed anti-aircraft guns many years ago together with the first generation of ammunition..
The PG99 (Export) is Cameroon took delivery of PG99’s in 2013, which were procured under a China EXIM Bank loan that also included the procurement of BBR AFVs. This delivery also included radar systems. The Sichuan Military Electronics Industries Group Company (SEMIC) 825 fire-control radars are used with the PG99s and have a maximum range of 40 km..
