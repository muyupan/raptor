This document describes the M985 HEMTT American 8x8 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) Cargo Truck.

M985 Cargo
This variant is the same as the 977 except that it is equipped with an 89,100-ft lb (12,319-kg m) heavy-duty crane. It is used to carry Multiple Launched Rocket System (MLRS) ammunition.

The Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) is an eight-wheel drive, diesel-powered, 10-short-ton (9,100 kg), tactical truck used by the US military and others. In evolving configurations, it has been in continuous production since 1982. The M977 HEMTT entered service with the U.S. Army as a replacement for the M520 Goer.

By mid 2019, around 35,000 HEMTTs in various configurations had been produced by Oshkosh Defense through new-build contracts and around 13,000 of these had been re-manufactured. Current variants have the A4 suffix.

The 10×10 Oshkosh Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) is the U.S. Marines’ equivalent to the U.S. Army's Oshkosh 8×8 HEMTT and Oshkosh 10×10 Palletized Load System (PLS). The Marines do not use the HEMTT or PLS, and the Army does not use the LVSR, but both services use a common trailer (M1076) with all three truck types.

The HEMTT's objective is to provide heavy transport capabilities for supply and re-supply of combat vehicles and weapons systems. Compared to earlier generation 5-ton trucks in U.S. Army service it offers increased payload and mobility. The HEMTT is available in a variety of configurations, including cargo, tanker, tractor and wrecker.

The HEMTT was developed from the outset as a tactical truck, but to minimize procurement and life cycle costs included militarized commercial automotive components where possible, these including the engine and transmission. Some components used in early HEMTTs are common with the Oshkosh Logistics Vehicle System (LVS) vehicles which were supplied to the U.S. Marine Corps.

With the exception of the M984 wrecker variant (254 × 89 × 9.5 mm, front; 356 × 89 × 9.5 mm, rear), on all HEMTT variants the chassis is formed of 257 × 89 × 9.5 mm heat-treated carbon manganese steel with a yield strength of 758 MPa. Bolted construction with Grade 8 bolts is used throughout. A centrally mounted self-recovery winch is an option and this is fitted to around 20% of production.

The HEMTT's two-door forward control cab seats two. It is of heavy-duty welded steel construction with corrosion-resistant sheet metal skins. Simula Inc. (acquired by Armor Holdings in 2003 and now BAE Systems) supplied 186 add-on cab armoring kits for use in the former Yugoslavia. These were not issued, but from 2004 were used in Iraq. BAE systems supplied a next-generation armor kit for the HEMTT and by late-2006 had supplied the U.S. Army with around 3600 kits for the Oshkosh HEMTT and PLS. The HEMTT A4 is fitted with the slightly larger from the Oshkosh PLS A1. This cab complies with the U.S. Army's Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) requirements of an A- and B-kit armoring philosophy. It also comes as standard with integrated floor armor, an integrated mount for a machine gun and gunner protection kit, and air-conditioning.

A Detroit Diesel 8V92TA V-8 two-stroke diesel developing 445 hp (332 kW) is fitted in HEMTT A0 and A1 models, with the DDECIV version of this engine fitted to A2 HEMTTs. An EPA 2004 compliant Caterpillar (CAT) C-15 six-cylinder, 15.2-liter diesel developing a peak of 515 hp (384 kW) is fitted to HEMTT A4 models. HEMTT A0 and A1 models are fitted with an Allison HT 740D 4F/1R automatic transmission, torque converter, and Oshkosh 55,000-pound (25,000 kg) two-speed transfer case. HEMTT A2 models have the Allison HD 4560P 6F/1R automatic transmission. HEMTT A4 models are fitted with an Allison 4500SP 5F/1R automatic transmission and an uprated version of Oshkosh's 55,000-pound (25,000 kg) two-speed transfer case.

The front axles on all HEMTTs are single-reduction Oshkosh 46K, the rear are Dana single-reduction which vary according to configuration. Drive to the front axles is selectable and all axles have differential locks. Suspension on A0/A1/A3 models is by Hendrickson leaf springs with equalizing beams. Suspension on A4 models is Holland air suspension, load rating on the rear axles varying by configuration. Tire size is 1600 R20 on all models, and standard tire fit is Michelin XZL.

All models are capable of fording water crossings up to 48 in (120 cm) deep, and can climb a gradient of at least 60%. All original variants are air transportable in the C-130. All variants are air-transportable in the C-17.

Original HEMTT models now have the suffix A0. Only the M984 wrecker was produced in A1 configuration. All models were produced in A2 configuration. The A3 suffix is applied to HEMTT technology demonstrators with a diesel-electric drive system. Current HEMTT production models have the suffix A4.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bahrain, Brazil, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the M985 HEMTT American 8x8 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) Cargo Truck:
The M977 is The M977 cargo truck variant is the base member of the HEMTT family. The current model is the M977A4; there was no M977A1. In addition to the basic M977A0/A2/A4 cargo truck, two other variants are available. The M977A0/A2/A4 Electrical Power Plant (EPP) has an extended cargo body (6.041 m (19.82 ft) inside length) and is used to hold and transport generators for the Patriot air-defence missile system. There is no material handling crane on the EPP. The M977A0/A2/A4 Large Repair Parts Transporter (LRPT) and the basic M977 cargo truck are fitted with a light-duty Grove materials handling crane mounted at the rear of the chassis..
The M978 is The M978 is a 9,500 liter capacity tanker. The current model is the M978A4; there was no M978A1. The M978A0 was produced in both potable water (approximately 18) and fuel servicing truck variants, the A2 and A4 models have only been produced in the fuel servicing truck variant..
The M983 Tractor is The M983 is a tractor unit for use with the trailer-mounted MIM-104 Patriot missile system. It can also be used with the Interim Stryker Recovery System, or other trailers. An earlier variant fitted with a 30 kW generator and crane mounted behind the cab was used to tow the Pershing II Erector Launcher in CONUS (a M1001 MAN tractor was used in West Germany). The M983A2/A4 Light Equipment Transporter (LET) tractor is mainly used to transport construction and engineer equipment. It has a 45,000 lb (20,000 kg)) 2 speed hydraulic winch mounted behind the cab used to load the trailer. It does not have a self-recovery winch..
The M984A1 Wrecker is The M984 wrecker is the only HEMTT variant to have been produced in the A1 configuration, and this resulting in the change of recovery crane and retrieval system between A0 and A1 configurations. The current model is the M984A4. Standard equipment includes a 27,240 kg (60,050 lb) capacity two-speed recovery winch, a rear-mounted 11,340 kg capacity vehicle retrieval system, and a 6,350 kg (14,000 lb) at 2.74 m (9.0 ft) capacity Grove materials handling crane.
