This document describes the LD 2000 (LuDun-2000) Chinese 8x8 Mobile Air Defense Gun Missile System.

The LD2000 (LuDun-2000) is a ground-based anti-aircraft air defense weapon system designed, developed, and manufactured by the Chinese Defense Company NORINCO (China North Industries Corporation). The system was unveiled during the defense exhibition IDEX in 2005. Modern critical ground assets are vulnerable to a growing number of precision-guided weapon and aerial threats, and particularly to cruise missiles. In response. China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) has developed a unique and effective solution to these threats - the LD2000 Ground-Based Close-In Weapon System based on the proven CIWS of naval application. LD2000 is an effective and efficient weapon system for close-in air defense in various scenarios. With highly accurate firepower and multiple target engagement capability. The LD2000 achieves satisfying hit probability to typical low-altitude, high-speed cruise missile targets. The system is also highly capable of intercepting low-altitude aircraft and UAVs. The LD2000 can intercept flying targets at a velocity of Mach 2 or below. It has a reaction time of 9.8 sec and the capability to track up to 48 targets.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
