This document describes the 59N6E Protivnik-GE Russian Towed 3D Mobile Surveillance Radar.

The 59N6E Protivnik-GE is a 3D mobile surveillance radar developed by Almaz Antey Concern to detect a wide array of airborne targets at a distance between 10 kilometers and 400 kilometers flying at altitudes of up to 200 kilometers. The radar system features a digital phased array antenna and digital signal processing system with the ability to perform target identification while providing the critical information to air defense systems as well as automated command and control (C2). The Protivnik-GE radar can detect targets flying at speeds between 60 and 8,000 kilometers per hour while tracking up to 150 airborne targets simultaneously. This radar system has been deployed within the Russian Armed Forces and was supplied to Egypt in 2017.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Egypt, Russian Federation.
