This document describes the Kurganets-25 Russian Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The Kurganets-25 is a tracked, 25-ton modular vehicle that can be used as either an infantry fighting vehicle or an armored personnel carrier depending upon the turret that is mounted to the hull. As part of the Russian armyâ€™s efforts to modularize their combat systems, the Kurganets-25 will evolve into various models, gradually replacing BMP, BMD, MT-LB and other types of tracked Soviet armored platforms. The Kurganets-25 will have modular armor that can be upgraded for specific threats. 
The Kurganets-25 IFV and APC variants were first seen in public during rehearsals for the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade. 

The Kurganets-25 is designed to bring the Russian tracked troop carrier fleet up to standard with Western designs like the American M2 Bradley and British Warrior, which outclassed their Soviet Cold War BMP-series counterparts. Kurganets-25 is based on Armata Universal Combat Platform while being lighter than the T-15 Armata "heavy IFV" based on the same and similar to wheeled VPK-7829 Bumerang. The heavily armed infantry fighting vehicle carries 6-7 troops and a lightly armed APC carries 8 troops. Other variants proposed for the Kurganets include an armored ambulance, an 82 mm Vasilek mortar carrier, anti-tank vehicle, armored recovery vehicle, a reconnaissance vehicle, a command vehicle, and an armored engineering vehicle.  The vehicle represents a departure from traditional Russian low profile designs, having a higher floor more suited for mounted combat rather than troop carrying, which also provides better IED and mine protection. While the T-15 is expected to be deployed with T-14 tanks in armored formations, Kurganets-25 platforms will equip mechanized units.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Russian Federation, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).
