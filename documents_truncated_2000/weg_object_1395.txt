The Note is The K-329 Belgorod (Project 09852) Russian Nuclear Submarine armed with six ‘2м39′ Poseidon torpedoes. These are a whole new category of weapons not fielded by any other navy. They have been described as ‘Intercontinental Nuclear-Powered Nuclear-Armed Autonomous Torpedoes’. At over 20 meters (65 feet) long and in effect they are giant underwater drones with practically unlimited range and a nuclear warhead. And their expected performance (around 70 knots and 1,000 meters in depth) means that they cannot be countered with existing weapons..
