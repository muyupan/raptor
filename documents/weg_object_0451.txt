This document describes the 9P132 Russian 122mm One-Round Rocket Launcher.

The 9P132 is a lightweight, man-portable, rocket launching system used by guerrilla, special purpose forces, or other light forces. The 9P132 is only effective as a harassment or interdiction weapon. The 9P132 is broken down for man-pack transport into two one-man loads – the tube, AKA “Grad-P” (27 kg), and the tripod sight assembly with a remote firing device (28 kg).  The tripod legs fold for ease of handling.
Each 9M22M rocket is broken down into two one-man loads for transport. It takes approximately two minutes for the assembly of the rocket. When assembled, the launcher has three-course elevation positions, with the final elevation set by means of an elevation screw. The crew uses an electrical remote control with an electrical impulse generator and battery to fire the launcher. The 9P132 is incapable of firing the 9-foot version rockets of the BM-21 and similar 122mm systems.
The system was developed in the middle of the 1960s for Soviet special units and was used by Vietnamese forces at war with the US, under the designation DKZ-B.   It was not accepted for regular service with the Russian Army, but it was and is still popular with paramilitary and guerrilla forces.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Cuba, Russian Federation, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).
