This document describes the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal (Dagger) Russian Air-Launched Ballistic Missile.

The Kh-47M2 Kinzhal (Dagger) entered service in December 2017 and is a Russian, nuclear-capable, air-launched, ballistic missile (ALBM).  It has a claimed range of more than 2,000 km (1,200 mi), Mach 10 speed, and an ability to perform evasive maneuvers at every stage of its flight. It can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads and can be launched from MiG-31K interceptors Tu-22M3 bombers. It has been deployed at air bases in Russia's Southern Military District. 
The missile is designed to target US and NATO warships posing a threat to strategic missile systems in Russiaâ€™s European region.  It has the additional task of destroying NATO missile defense systems, ballistic missile defense ships, and land objects close to Russia's borders. It is allegedly designed to overcome any known or planned US air or missile defense systems including MIM-104 Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, and Aegis Combat System. 
The missile's first stage is probably shared with 9K720 Iskander and the guidance section is specifically designed for this missile.  The missile accelerates to hypersonic speed within seconds of launch and, as mentioned, performs maneuvers at all stages of the flight trajectory to evade enemy missile defenses.
Russian media claims the missile's range is 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi; 1,100 NMI) when carried by the MiG-31K and 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi; 1,600 NMI) when carried by the Tu-22M3.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
