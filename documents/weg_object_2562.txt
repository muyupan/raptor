This document describes the Marder 1A5 German Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

Marder 1A5 has improved mine protection. Additional anti-mine armor was fitted and the interior was completely remodeled in order to improve survivability against mine blasts. A total of 74 Marder 1A3 vehicles were upgraded to the 1A5 standard between 2003 and 2004. The Marder 1A5 can be recognized by the storage box on the glacis plate and two stowage boxes mounted on either side on the roof at the rear. It also has new armored side skirts that protect the upper part of the suspension and these have a straight lower part rather than the wavy rubberized reinforced skirt fitted to the standard Marder 1A3.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Chile, Germany, Indonesia, Jordan.
