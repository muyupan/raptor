This document describes the PSNR-5 (1-RL-133) Russian Ground Surveillance Radar.

The PSNR-5 Russian Ground Surveillance Radar is used to search for fixed and moving ground targets and to track their movements when the use of other technical means of reconnaissance (from the vehicle equipment) is excluded or not appropriate.
It can detect the nature and polar coordinates of the target(s), in this case distance and bearing.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
