This document describes the WZ-120 (Type 59) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The WZ-120 (Type 59) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT) is a Chinese-produced version of the Soviet T-54A tank, the earliest model of the ubiquitous T-54/55 series. The first vehicles were produced in 1958 and it was accepted into service in 1959, with serial production beginning in 1963. Over 10,000 of the tanks were produced by the time production ended in 1980 with approximately 5,500 serving with the Chinese armed forces. The tank formed the backbone of the Chinese People's Liberation Army until the early 2000s with an estimated 5,000 of the later Type 59-I and Type 59-II variants in service in 2002.

The Type 59 was modified several times during its service. It was also the basis of several later Chinese tank designs including the Type 69 and Type 79 tanks.

The Type 59 is almost identical to the early production of Soviet T-54As, however, there are some key differences. The Type 59 was not originally fitted with the infrared searchlight or main gun stabilization of the T-54.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Congo, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Sudan, Viet Nam, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

Here is Variants information for the WZ-120 (Type 59) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The Domestic models is Type 59
The basic variant, a T-54A clone without IR searchlight. Entered production in 1957.

Type 59-I
Improved variant fitted with a Type 69-II 100 mm rifled gun, as well as a laser rangefinder, hydraulic servo-system, primitive fire-control system, automatic fire suppression system, and rubber track skirt. The Type 59-I includes several versions with different armor and fire control configurations.

Type 59-II
The Type 59-II (also known as WZ-120B) is an upgrade mounting a 105 mm rifled gun, similar to the Royal Ordnance L7, and adding an image intensification/infrared night sight. Mass increased to 36.5 tonnes.

Type 59-IIA
Although Type 59-II is a very successful design, the tank still relies on the West to supply parts. As a result, the Type 59-IIA was developed. By the end of 1984, the China First Tractor Factory and other production facilities began to develop a further upgrade to the Type 59-II. A prototype was completed by October 1985, featuring an improved 105mm Type 83 gun, copied version from the Royal Ordnance L7, with a thermal sleeve, new domestic light spot fire control system with a 2-axis stabilizer, and composite armor. The automatic fire suppression system and automatic fire extinguishing devices were improved so that they could be used while generating smoke or firing the onboard smoke grenade launchers.

Type 59D1
The Type 59D1 (also known as WZ-120C) is an upgrade with explosive reactive armor, a computerized stabilized fire-control system, the 105 mm gun of the Type 59-II, and a night vision system.

Type 59D
Type 59D (also known as WZ-120D) is an upgrade with the Type 59D1, though it is strange. The Type 59D has a longer 105 mm gun, called Type 83A, or Type 94. The gun has a range of 2000 m and may fire ATGMs out to 5500 m. A thermal sight is available.

Type 59G
An upgrade of the Type 59, featuring a redesigned turret and armor. It uses a turret similar to that of the Type 96A, a 125 mm gun, modern fire control systems, arrow-shaped armor, spaced armor, and possibly third-generation subsystems.

Jaguar
The Jaguar was a prototype vehicle based on the Type 59 chassis that was jointly developed by the United States and China during the 1980s, made possible by the US-Chinese détente of the 1970s. Planned to replace China's existing tank fleet, as well as for the export market, the tank featured improvements to the standard Type 59's engine, armament, armor, turret, optics, electronics, fire control, and suspension. Following Tiananmen Square massacre, American-Chinese relations soured and the Chinese withdrew from the project. The Americans continued alone and successfully completed the design, however the end of the Cold War saw a glut in the international tank market, and thus no orders were ever placed for the vehicle.

Type 62 Light Tank
In the late 1950s, the PLA submitted requirements for a light tank more suitable for operations in China's southern region. Development on the new Type 62 tank began in 1958, which was a scaled-down Type 59 MBT with simplified equipment. The Type 62 light tank entered batch production in 1963, and approx. 800 were produced by 1978. The Type 62 light tank weighs only 21 tons, and is equipped with a Type 62-85TC 85 mm rifled gun, and 3 machine guns. An improved Type 62-I version was produced with better FCS with laser rangefinder and turret storage racks for added protection. Other versions based on the Type 62 include the Type 79 recovery vehicle (prototype only) and Type 82 earth-mover. The PLA deployed the Type 62 light tank to Vietnam during the 1979 Sino-Vietnam conflict. They found that the thin armor of the Type 62 tank could be penetrated easily by hand-held anti-tank weapons, such as the 40 mm RPG. The Type 62 tank suffered severe losses during the conflict, which convinced the PLA to develop new second-generation MBTs. The Type 62 tank received a major upgrade in 2000, with a new welded turret, vertically stabilized 105 mm rifled gun, fire-control system, night vision device, smoke grenade launchers, and explosive reactive armor (ERA) package.

Type 69 / 79
Improved Type 59 MBT built by 617 Factory (Inner Mongolia First Machine Group Co. Ltd). Only saw limited service in the PLA, but was an export success in the 1980s with more than 2,000 sold worldwide.

Type 73
This armored recovery vehicle is a Type 59 with its turret removed. The vehicle is armed with a single 12.7 mm machine gun. This armored recovery vehicle is not believed to have a winch and is limited to towing operations.

Type 59 Heavy Infantry Fighting Vehicle
The modernized HIFV model of Type 59 weighs around 40 tons and can carry up to seven passengers. Modifications include moving the engine to the front of the vehicle chassis, increasing tank armor including explosive reactive armor on all sides, and installing a rear door for dismounting infantry.

QN-506
It is a modernized variant of the Type 59 using the tank's chassis similar to its Russian counterpart the BMPT Terminator. The vehicle was first appeared at the Zhuhai Air Show in China in November 2018 and is armed with two QN-502C anti-tank missiles, ten QN-201 multi-purpose mini-missiles, four S-507 loitering munitions, an unmanned 30 mm cannon, a 7.62 mm machine gun, six grenade launchers, and a quadcopter surveillance drone..
The Foreign variants is United Kingdom designed a variant with a 105-mm L7 gun as an upgrade package for owners of the Type 59. No Type 59s served with British forces. Marconi offered their Marksman anti-aircraft system as a conversion to operators of the Type 59. The Marksman consisted of a twin 35 mm autocannon system in a turret that could be fitted to almost any MBT.

Iran
Iran operates Type T-72Z based on Type 59.

North Korea
North Korea operates Kok'san – 170 mm artillery piece, based on the Type 59 chassis.

Pakistan operates Al-Zarrar – Heavy Industries Taxila of Pakistan has introduced the Al-Zarrar Main Battle Tank. The Al-Zarrar series was designed to improve and rebuild the Pakistani army's Type 59 tanks by way of more modern armament, fire control, defensive equipment, etc.
