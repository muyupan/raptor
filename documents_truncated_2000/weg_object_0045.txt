This document describes the ZTZ-96A (Type 96A) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The ZTZ-96A (Type 96A) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT) entered service in 2006, reflecting the developments made in Chinese tank design such as the arrow-shaped add-on turret armor also found on Type 99. The vehicle described below is offered for export in the format described below with the designation of VT2. A total of 42 rounds are carried. Additional "arrow-shaped" modular armor similar to the Type 99 is installed on the turret front. The back of the hull is now completely flat compared to the Type 96. The Type 96A was first revealed in 2006, but in-service tanks were first seen in a military parade in 2009.

The ZTZ-96A (Type 96)  is a third-generation upgrade of the Type 96. Its internal electronics may have been upgraded to Type 99 standards. The visual profile of the ZTZ-96A (Type 96)  is similar to the Type 99. However, the Type 96A can be distinguished from the Type 99 by the driver's position on the left side of the hull. FY-4 ERA was added on the front upper glacis. The vehicle is equipped with a thermal imager. Features an upgraded 800 hp engine.

A laser defense system similar to the Shtora has been installed as well. Electro-optical jammers which are able to jam enemy-guided missiles, rangefinders, and designators are found on the tank.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
