This document describes the Azmat Class Pakistani Fast Attack Craft.

PNS Azmat is the lead ship of the Azmat class fast attack crafts of the Pakistan Navy and is based on the Chinese Type 037II Houjian-class missile boat. Azmat was commissioned on 24 April 2012 at Tianjin, China after being launched on 20 September 2011. It has the pennant number 1013.

PNS Azmat is considered by many[citation needed] as a stealth boat, due to its hull and design, even though it was not so designed. The small fast attack craft is a green water vessel and does not have blue water capabilities, and so it is mostly used to patrol the coast, and to assist the Coast Guard in any special operations that require extensive firepower.

PNS Azmat is equipped with eight C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles, carried in two quadruple missile containers. The vessel uses a fully automatic 23 mm gun. The decision to install the 23 mm gun was due to lack of hull space, which meant less storage area for 75-100 mm rounds required for larger guns and weight requirements. Also a 23 mm gun is much easier to maintain than larger 75 mm to 100 mm guns. For its defensive capabilities, Azmat uses a CIWS. Also, the boat's speed itself is also considered as a defense system, as it can outmaneuver older, less maneuverable anti-ship missiles.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Pakistan.
