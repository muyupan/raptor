This document describes the RPG-28 Klyukva Russian Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher.

The RPG-28 Klyukva ("Cranberry") is a Russian handheld anti-tank rocket launcher.

The RPG-28 was unveiled in 2007 at IDEX Abu Dhabi by the State Research and Production Enterprise, Bazalt as a modern anti-tank rocket launcher designed to defeat modern and future tanks with advanced reactive and composite armor as well as fortified infantry. It was offered for export in 2008. Officially adopted by the Russian Government in December 2011.

The RPG-28 shares a close resemblance with the RPG-27 in that it is a portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single shot capacity. The RPG-28 has a larger diameter round than the RPG-27 which enables the RPG-28 to achieve higher armor penetration performance. The PG-28 round is a 125 mm tandem-shaped charge with a weight of 12 kg and a range of 300 meters. The round has a stated penetration capability in excess of 1000 mm RHA (after ERA) and 3000 mm of brick. The loaded weight is 13.5 kg.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
