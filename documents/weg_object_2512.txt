This document describes the LRV 600 British 6x6 Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV).

The Light Reconnaissance Vehicle 600 (LRV 600) is a 6x6 conversion kit to be fitted to the LRV 400
4x4. By fitting the modular 3rd axle and hamper extension kit to the 4x4, the user can significantly
increase both payload and capacity. The LRV is the only vehicle that can be converted from 4x4 to
6x6 in this weight category, globally.

new ‘Mk 2’ LRV has become the latest addition to the Supacat range of high performance off-road military vehicles.
For the ‘Mk 2’ LRV, Supacat have taken the rolling chassis and automotive systems from the Land Rover Discovery
and adapted them for specialist military applications. Supacat are able to offer this vehicle as a fully integrated military
variant including the entire spectrum of Integrated Logistic Support services.

The ability to travel at high speeds through harsh environments’ is the LRV‘s strength, offering the user an ideal lightweight rapid intervention vehicle for special forces, border patrol, reconnaissance or strike forces.
The proven, rugged reliability of the Discovery base platform combined with Supacat’s defence specific enhancements provides superb levels of performance, supportability and safety. The LRV’s size and weight
enables effective air portability, including tactical CH-47 internal loading. The LRV 600 can be converted from 6x6 to 4x4 to provide a flexible alternative configuration to meet the tactical battlefield requirements of the day
