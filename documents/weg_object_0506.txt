This document describes the Fadjr-5 Iranian 333mm Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS).

The Fajr-5 ("Dawn") is an Iranian 333mm long-range multiple launch rocket system (MLRS). The Fajr-5 was developed during the 1990s and has since been exported to various armed actors in the Middle East. The Fajr is among the deadliest artillery rocket systems in the world.

The Fajr-5 launcher fires four 6.48 meter long, 333mm, Fajr-5 artillery rockets, with a range of 75 kilometers (50 mi), weighing 915 kilograms each and carrying 175kg fragmentation warheads with 90kg of high explosive (HE). Most Fajr-5 rockets are unguided; in 2017 Iran introduced a variant, the Fajr-5C, which adds GPS guidance.

The Fajr-5 is primarily used by the Iranian Army Ground Force to attack large, fixed, high-value targets, like airfields and military bases. In addition, the system is also used by anti-Israel militant and terrorist groups to target Israeli population centers. Finally, the system has a niche role in use by the IRGC-N as an unguided anti-ship rocket system for the Persian Gulf.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Libya, Syria.

Here is Variants information for the Fadjr-5 Iranian 333mm Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS):
The Fadjr 5C is Fadjr 5C is a new version unveiled in 2017. It uses 300 mm guided rockets similar to those of the Chinese SY-300. These have a range of up to 130 km. These rockets are accurate out to 200 meters using inertial guidance system, and out to 50 meters, using inertial guidance system with satellite navigation update. Due to significantly increased range and accuracy the Fadjr-5C is even more deadlier. It looks like the same launcher vehicle can use a mix of older 333 mm unguided rockets and new 300 mm guided rockets..
