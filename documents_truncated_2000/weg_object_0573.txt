This document describes the PLZ-45 (Type 88) Chinese 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The PLZ-45 or Type 88 is a 155mm self-propelled howitzer developed by Norinco in the 1990s for the export market. It is based on Norinco's Type 89 (PLL01) 155mm/45-calibre towed gun-howitzer. 
The PLZ-45 self-propelled howitzer is used by the People's Liberation Army of China, People's National Army (Algeria), Kuwaiti Army and Saudi Arabian Army.
Operated by a crew of five (commander, gunner, two loaders and a driver), the PLZ-45 is armed with a 155mm, 45-calibre main gun, with a semi-automatic loader and an electrically controlled and hydraulically operated ram that enables projectile loading to take place at any angle of elevation with the charge being loaded manually. The turret has an elevation of +72 to -3 degrees with 360 degree traverse. 
Secondary weapons include a roof-mounted W-85 heavy machine gun and two sets of four-barrel smoke grenade launchers on the turret's side.
Ammunition is stored at the rear of the turret. A total of 30 rounds for the gun-howitzer and 480 rounds for the machine gun are carried on board. 24 howitzer rounds are carried in the loader and 6 rounds on the right side below the loader.
The fire-control system of the PLZ-45 includes an automatic laying system, optical sighting system, gun orientation and navigation system, and a GPS receiver.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, China, Ethiopia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia.
