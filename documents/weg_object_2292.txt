This document describes the POMZ-2M Russian Anti-Personnel Mine.

The POMZ-2M is a stake-mounted anti-personnel fragmentation mine made in the former Soviet Union. The body of the mine is a cast-iron thick-walled tube with five rows of cast fragmentation "chunks". This is usually mounted on a short wooden stake. Because the mine is easy to copy, dimensions and color may vary. The body of the mine is usually painted olive green. The wooden stakes may be green, brown or unpainted.

The POMZ-2M has a threaded hole in the top into which its fuze is screwed. The mine has been copied in many countries.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Cambodia, Myanmar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Viet Nam.
