This document describes the ZBD-08 (WZ502G) Chinese Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The ZBD-08 is a new Chinese infantry fighting vehicle. Its industrial designation is the WZ502G. The ZBD-08 is a ATGM version of the ZBD-04 and is listed as an export of the ZBD-04. It is a revised and improved version of the previous ZBD-04, which is already in service with the PLA. The new improved vehicle appeared in 2007. It seems that the ZBD-08 IFV, together with its numerous variants, is being produced in large numbers for the Chinese army. It replaces the Type 86 IFV, which is a copy of the Soviet BMP-1.

   The new ZBD-08 has a number of improvements. Its hull was slightly redesigned in order to improve armor protection at a cost of reduced amphibious capabilities. The previous ZBD-04 IFV has the great amphibious capability and can operate at Sea State 2-3. However, this feature is not required by typical army units. The overall height of the vehicle was reduced. Also, the new vehicle is heavier due to increased armor.

   The ZBD-08 infantry fighting vehicle has a welded steel armor hull. Baseline armor is thicker and presumably offers better protection. Add-on modular armor can be fitted for a higher level of protection. It is claimed that the front arc withstands 30 mm armor-piercing rounds. Sides withstand 14.5 mm rounds. Turret roof and rear end provide protection from 7.62 mm armor-piercing rounds. Side skirts were added for improved protection. Also, it may be fitted with an indigenous active laser protection system.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
