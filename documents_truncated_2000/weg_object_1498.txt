This document describes the Gorya-Class (Project 12660 Class) Russian Deep Ocean Minesweeper.

The Gorya class is a group of minesweepers built for the Soviet Navy in the late 1980s. Three ships were started of which two were completed and are in service with the Russian Navy. The Soviet designation was Project 12660. The ships are designed for deep ocean sweeping of captor mines with sophisticated mine detection equipment. Sweeping gear includes two submersibles as well as conventional sweeps. Russian press boasted that the Project 12660 minesweepers were the first sweepers in the history of Soviet military shipbuilding capable of not only destroying the "Captor" mines, "Colas" ASW coverage buoys, and other enemy underwater objects at depths of up to 1,000 meters.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
