This document describes the AN-74 (Coaler-B) Ukrainian Transport/Passenger Aircraft.

AN-74 (Coaler-B) is a Ukrainian transport aircraft developed by Antonov. It is a variant of the An-72.

The An-72 and An-74 get their nickname, Cheburashka, from the large engine intake ducts, which resemble the oversized ears of the popular Soviet animated mouse character of the same name. The An-74 was initially an upgrade of the An-72 test aircraft, intended to be used in the Arctic and Antarctica; and had the designation An-72A "Arctic". The aircraft's main purpose is to deliver cargo, equipment, and personnel over short- and medium-range routes in any climatic conditions ranging from −60 to 45 °C (−76 to 113 °F) and at any latitude, including the North Pole, and high altitudes. It can operate to and from low-grade airstrips such as concrete, pebble, ice, and snow aerodromes.

Produced in tandem with the An-72, the An-74 can be fitted with wheel-ski landing gear, de-icing equipment, and a number of other upgrades allowing the aircraft to support operations in the Arctic or Antarctic environments. An unusual design feature of the An-74 (as well as An-72) is the use of the Coandă effect to improve STOL performance, utilizing engine exhaust gases blown over the wing's upper surface to boost lift. The powerplant used is the Lotarev D-36 turbofan engine. The An-74 bears some resemblance to the unsuccessful Boeing YC-14, a prototype design from the early 1970s which had also used overwing engines.

The rear fuselage of the aircraft has a hinged loading ramp with a rear fairing that slides backward and up to clear the opening. The An-74 has a payload of 7.5 tons including up to ten passengers in the cargo version, or up to 52 seats in the passenger version; the operating ceiling is 10,100 meters (33,100 ft), and the cruising speed is 550 to 700 kilometers per hour (300 to 380 kn; 340 to 430 mph).

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Egypt, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Russian Federation, Turkmenistan, Ukraine.
