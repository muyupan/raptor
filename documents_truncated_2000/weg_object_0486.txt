This document describes the QSZ-92 (Type 92) Chinese 9mm/5.8mm Semi-Automatic Pistol.

The Type 92 / QSZ-92 is a modern military pistol that is now a standard sidearm of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and many police organizations inside China. Designed during the early 1990s and currently manufactured by state-owned ordnance organizations, it is now available in two externally similar, but internally different versions. The first one, intended for military use inside China, is the QSZ92-5.8. It is chambered for indigenous 5.8×42 DAP-5.8 ammunition, which is loaded with pointed, steel-core bullets. The second version, known as QSZ92-9, is primarily intended for police use and is chambered for ubiquitous 9×19 Luger ammunition, which is known in Chinese service as DAP92-9. The latter version is also manufactured for commercial, and export sales as NORINCO NP-42 and CF-98, with slight variations in markings and external appearance. The CF-98 is also available chambered for 7.62×25 Tokarev ammunition.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Guinea, South Sudan.
