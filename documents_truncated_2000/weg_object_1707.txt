This document describes the HUGIN Norwegian Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

The HUGIN Norwegian Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is the most successful commercial AUV available. It is the most capable AUV combining IHO quality positioning with the highest resolution sensors on the market. HUGIN collects data from many different sensors concurrently, providing a complete data product from a single mission. Hugin is available in several configurations and depth ratings. The main depth ratings are 3,000 meters; 4,500 meters; 6,000 meters.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Norway.
