This document describes the 9S737 Ranzhir Russian 6x6 Mobile Command Center.

The Ranzhir series of mobile command posts was originally developed for the PVO-SV to provide a tracked and hardened ADCP for batteries of point defence weapons, such as SPAAGs and SAM systems. 
9S737 vehicle was designed by Belarusian scientific and research institute of automatization technologies (NIISA), currently "AGAT–Control Systems". A. V. Shershnev was appointed chief designer of 9S737 vehicle.

State trials of the system were held from August 1987 till June 1988 at Embi testing range (nowadays at Kazakhstan). In 1989 it was approved for military.

Mass production was started at Minsk NPO Agat, but later transferred to Radiozavod (Penza)

Early variants were deployed to provide battery C3 for the SA-15, SA-17, SA-19 systems. More recent variants are used with the SA-13, replacing legacy ADCPs, and the new wheeled SA-15 and SA-22, in a wheeled configuration. A single Ranzhir usually supports 4 to 6 TELARs, SPAAGMs or SPAAGs.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belarus, Russian Federation.
