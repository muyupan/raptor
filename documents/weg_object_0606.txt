This document describes the Type 54-1 Chinese 122mm Towed Howitzer.

The Type 54-1 is the Chinese version of the Russian 122-mm M-30 (M1938) towed howitzer. It is virtually identical to the original, apart from its short gun tube with no muzzle brake. It is thought to be the first large-caliber artillery weapon manufactured in China.

The gun has a hydraulic buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator recoil system. It has a split rail carriage and a hinged screw breech mechanism. A gun shield is provided. The Type 54-1 is typically towed by a 6 x 6 vehicle.

The weapon is fitted with a Type 58 panoramic sight, weighing 2.7 lb (1.2 kg) with a magnification of 3.7x and a 10-deg field of view; it also has a Type 58 collimator sight with a 10-deg field of view.

The system uses a variable nine-charge propellant system and can fire at least four types of projectiles: high-explosive, smoke, illumination and incendiary. A leaflet shell containing 24 lb (11 kg) of leaflets can also be used. China has also developed a prototype 122-mm cargo round with six layers of high-explosive anti-tank bomblets.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), China, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Pakistan, Tanzania, Viet Nam.
