This document describes the MiG-19 (Farmer) Russian Fighter Aircraft.

The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 (Russian: Микоян и Гуревич МиГ-19; NATO reporting name: Farmer) is a Soviet second-generation, single-seat, twin jet-engined fighter aircraft, the world's first mass-produced supersonic aircraft. It was the first Soviet production aircraft capable of supersonic speeds in level flight. A comparable U.S. "Century Series" fighter was the North American F-100 Super Sabre, although the MiG-19 would primarily oppose the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and Republic F-105 Thunderchief over North Vietnam.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Poland, Romania.
