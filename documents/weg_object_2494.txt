This document describes the BRM-1K Russian Amphibious Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV).

The BRM-1K is a Russian armored reconnaissance vehicle. It was developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s by KB TchTZ and produced by Kurganmashzavod. The BRM-1K entered service in 1972.

The BRM-1K is for reconnaissance missions on the battlefield. It is developed from the BMP-1 Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle. It has the same architecture as the BMP-1 with the engine on the front right and the cockpit on the front left. The BRM-1K received a new two-seat turret unlike the single-seat turret of the BMP-1. The armament consists of the 73mm Grom 2A28 gun, identical to the BMP-1.

The BRM-1K is equipped with a 1RL133-1 terrestrial radar. On the first BRM-1 version the radar is deployed manually. On the BRM-1K version, the radar is automatically retractable into the compartment at the rear of the turret. The crew of the BRM-1K is composed of six men: machine commander, pilot, transmitter, navigation system operator, and two operators of reconnaissance systems.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, CFE Treaty, Georgia, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan, Ukraine.
