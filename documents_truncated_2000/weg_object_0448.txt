This document describes the 9A53-S Tornado-S Russian 300mm Multiple Launch Rocket System.

The Southern army District rocket unit stationed in the Astrakhan vicinity in south Russia has been completely rearmed with superior 9A53-S tornado-S multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). The heavy release rocket structures unit with 1,000 servicemen and over one hundred gadgets of navy hardware, along with combating and transporter-loader automobiles of the twister-S multiple release rocket structures were fashioned in overdue 2018. at the end of the 2019 training session, one of the large unit’s formations became granted the surprise pressure title.

The 9A53-S tornado is the maximum powerful and customary lengthy-variety multiple rocket launcher within the international. This model is aimed at replacing the preceding technology of Russian a couple of rocket launchers, along with BM-21 Grad, BM-27 Uragan and BM-30 Smerch. The 9A53-S machine is primarily based at the chassis of the MZKT-79306 eight×eight military truck, which gives proper tactical mobility. it is equipped with a 300mm Upgraded BM-30 Smerch multiple Rocket Launcher Modules, which could fireplace all cutting-edge Smerch rockets, together with HE-FRAG, incendiary, thermobaric, cluster with anti-personnel or anti-tank mines.

Each unit comprises 12 launchers that can fire a salvo or single missiles. The firing range is 120 km and can be increased up to 200 km. Tornado-S considerably accelerates the missions. It needs several minutes to fire the whole round of munitions and one minute to abandon the firing position and escape a retaliation strike. The Tornado-S t is a fully automatic weapon with new precision munitions of a bigger range. They have homing warheads. The power is comparable to Tochka-U missiles. However, Tochka-U can fire one missile while Tornado-S a salvo.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
