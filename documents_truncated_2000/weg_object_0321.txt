This document describes the M1A2 Abrams SEP American Main Battle Tank (MBT).

Approved for implementation in 1995, the M1A2 SEP (System Enhancement Package) is a technology upgrade and standardization program, whereby the Army's fleet of M1s and M1A2s will all be brought to a common standard. Most notable among the modifications will be the introduction of a standard under armor auxiliary power unit and the addition a crew compartment air conditioning and cooling unit.

Other modifications within the vehicle will include upgrades to the IVIS system (color display, full size keyboard, digital mapping and graphics generation capability, and voice recognition capabilities), upgrades to the Gunner's Primary Sight assembly, and improvement in the tank's intercom and radio communications systems. Production of the M1A2 was halted after the initial run of 627 vehicles. As part of the fleet upgrade program, 547 of the Army's current inventory of M1s are being upgraded to M1A2 SEP standards, which will require the complete remanufacturing of the turret, while the current fleet of M1A2s will undergo a retrofit to bring them up to SEP standards.

Further improvements on the M1A2 have occurred with the production of the M1A2 SEP . The package includes:
*enhanced Army Force XXI digital command and control capabilities;
*a second-generation, forward-looking IR (FLIR) system for the gunner and commander;
*user-friendly soldier/machine interface (SMI);
*under-armor auxiliary power unit (UAAPU);
*a new computerized mass-memory unit;
*color maps and displays.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Australia, CFE Treaty, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, United States of America.
