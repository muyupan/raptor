This document describes the RPG-18 Mukha Russian Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher.

The RPG-18 Mukha (Russian: Муха, romanized: Fly) is a Soviet short-range, disposable light anti-tank rocket launcher. The RPG-18 is very similar to the US M72-series LAW anti-tank rocket launcher. The RPG-18 has been succeeded by the RPG-22, a very similar design with a larger warhead.

The RPG-18 fires a 64 mm PG-18 HEAT warhead mounted on a small rocket capable of engaging targets within 200 meters. The warhead self-destructs 6 seconds after launch, placing definite limits on the range even if the sight was used that was effective with targets beyond 200 meters. The RPG-18 itself can penetrate up to 375 mm of conventional armor. However, performance is significantly diminished when the RPG-18 is employed against targets protected by HEAT-resistant ERA or composite armor.

Unlike better-known weapons, the RPG-18 requires only one operator because it is not reloadable. Assistant grenadiers are used to help reload the RPG-2, RPG-7, and RPG-16 systems.
