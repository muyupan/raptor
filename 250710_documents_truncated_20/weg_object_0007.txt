This document describes the Chieftain MK 5 British Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The Chieftain originated from a British Leyland design of a new tank, dating as early as 1950, when the War Office requested a replacement for the Centurion, as the Medium Tank No 2. The Mk.4 were two prototypes with increased fuel capacity and other minor modifications.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Oman, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
