This document describes the PPRU-M1 Russian Air Target Reconnaissance and Control Post.

The PPRU-M1 is known to be an improved version of the original PPRU-M. It features the Ovod radar system and operates operate in the same fashion as the original PPRU series in monitoring airspace for short range air defense systems.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the PPRU-M1 Russian Air Target Reconnaissance and Control Post:
The PPRU-1 (Dog Ear) is The PPRU-1 Dog Ear (with the Russian designation of 9S80) is a Russian ground-based, target-acquisition radar mounted on an MT-LB multi-purpose tracked vehicle or MT-LBu armored command and reconnaissance vehicle (ACRV). It uses an open-mesh, rounded-rectangle parabolic antenna. The radar supplies target alerting information to the SA-13 Gopher (Russian 9K35 Strela-10) surface-to-air missile (SAM) system. Deployment usually involves one system for each air defense battery/battalion. The Dog Ear is in service with SA-13 Gopher SAM batteries. In some cases, upgraded SA-13 systems may have replaced the Dog Ear. Production reportedly began in 1983..
The PPRU-M is The PPRU-M is an improved version of the original PPRU-1 and features the X-Band 9S80M radar system..
The PPRU-M1-2 is The PPRU-M1-2 is a modernized variant of the original PPRU. It is believed to be in service with the Russian Ground Forces and was first revealed in 2007. The vehicle is designed to provide the target detection and acquisition for up to three air defense batteries using either missiles or cannons. The PPRU-1M-2 replaces the analog Dog Ear Radar with the VNIIRT 9S80M1-2 X-band radar..
