This document describes the HQ-9 (Hong Qi 9) Chinese 8x8 Long-Range Air Defense Missile System.

The HQ-9 (Hong Qi-9) is a Surface to Air missile (SAM) engineered to attack airborne radars, essentially a surface-to-air anti-radiation missile (ARM) that can attack single or multiple electromagnetic radiating systems in the 1-18 Ghz band. It is also effective against fixed-wing aircraft, rotary wing aircraft, and UAVs. The HQ-9 has limited success against cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. Sources conflict in identifying the organization for combat of the HQ-9 battery and battalion. We assess that the following is true: A HQ-9 battery will usually have 8 TELs, 1 HT-233 Radar, and a TWS-312 CP. In addition, associated support vehicles (generator, missile resupply) may be seen in the area. 

The battery can operate independently of the battalion as listed above with some degradation in search capability. This degradation will be eliminated when the organization is deployed as a battalion as this will bring additional radars to include the Type 120 Low Angle Search Radar and the Type 305B Radar. The battalion formation will include 3 batteries (24 TELs) though some sources state that the battalion can control 48 TELs. 

The battalion also deploys with a site survey team which does not deploy with the battery, missile resupply, and its own TWS 312 Command Post. It is safe to assume that other mission and soldier support items will be found in the area of the HQ-9 formation. The HQ-9 has been designed to be able to use several of the Chinese radars. The assessment above is the most likely deployment course of action.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Morocco, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan.
