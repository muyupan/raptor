This document describes the XD-D11G Chinese HF Anti-Jamming Communication Radio.

The XD-D11G Chinese HF Anti-Jamming Communication Radio is a new generation of HF manpack anti-jamming communication equipment Communication digitalization is realized by channel and operation digitalization The communication quality and anti-jamming ability are improved in great extent It can also be equipped with 125W power amplifier to operate The transceiver has the functions of fixed frequency, hopping frequency, adaptive and automatic communications and more It can perform analog voice (same/different frequency for Rx and Tx), digital voice, data flow and other operations It has the functions of pulse interference canceling, noise reduction, self-test, online programming, encryption, remote control, over/under voltage protection Built-in automatic antenna tuner to tune the different types of antenna automatically Aluminum alloy telescopic case structure is adopted, so it is damp-proof, moldproof and salt-fog proof The transceiver is small in size, light in weight, easy in operation, so it is suitable for field operation.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
