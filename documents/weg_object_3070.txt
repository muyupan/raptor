This document describes the Type 59G (BD) Durjoy Bangladesh Main Battle Tank (MBT).

Type 59G(BD) Durjoy is an upgrade of the Type 59 tank. The Bangladesh Army's obsolete Type 59 tanks are being upgraded to Type 59G(BD) Durjoy locally with Chinese assistance. The name of the tank Durjoy means Indomitable in Bengali.

Since the year 2015, Bangladesh has been upgrading its Type 59 tanks, which were bought from China in the early 2000s. In that period of time, the army bought 780 tanks, that for many years were in service for the Bangladesh army but after a few years were starting to be older compared to its modern relatives. That's why the Bangladesh Army started a project to upgrade only 300 type 59 tanks by the time because they were still functional. In the first batch, the army rebuilt 174 as MK I, and by now the army has been rebuilding other 300 type 59 tanks as MK II. China says that if Bangladesh buys VT5: lightweight main battle tanks, then China will give 300 type 59 tanks for free.

The Type 59G Durjoy is one of the former MBTs of the Bangladesh Army, and the MK II is just as strong as the T 72 and it's also able to deliver serious damages into the latest versions of the T 72 because it does not have a sufficient armor to match completely with the latest T 72s, although it has much firepower than its closest relatives, such as the Indian Anjun tank or the Ukrainian Oplot tank, in fact, the Durjoy's APFSDS can penetrate 500 mm of armor with 2 km of distance, in the same distance the Arjun tank can penetrate only 200 mm of armor and the Ukrainian Oplot tank can penetrate 400 mm of armor. This process of rebuilding the type 59 tanks consists of the change of armor, armaments, and also the latest technology systems. In the process, only the hull and the chassis remains the same, because the metal of which the tank is made of can last for over 70 years, that's why great nations such as the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, and others still use the chassis and the hull of their older tanks. The tank measures 6,04 meters in length, 3,27 meters in width, and 2,59 meters in height all packed up with a weight of 40 tons for the MK I and 42 tons for the MK II.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh.

Here is Variants information for the Type 59G (BD) Durjoy Bangladesh Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The Type 59 is The basic variant, a T-54A clone without IR searchlight. Entered production in 1957..
The Type 59-I is Improved variant fitted with a Type 69-II 100 mm rifled gun, as well as a laser rangefinder, hydraulic servo-system, primitive fire-control system, automatic fire suppression system, and rubber track skirt. The Type 59-I includes several versions with different armour and fire control configurations..
The Type 59-II is The Type 59-II (also known as WZ-120B) is an upgrade mounting a 105 mm rifled gun, similar to the Royal Ordnance L7, and adding an image intensification/infrared night sight. Mass increased to 36.5 tons..
The Type 59D1 is The Type 59D1 (also known as WZ-120C) is an upgrade with explosive reactive armor, a computerized stabilized fire-control system, the 105 mm. gun of the Type 59-II, and a night vision system..
The Type 59G is An upgrade of the Type 59, featuring a redesigned turret and armor. It uses a turret similar to that of the Type 96A, a 125 mm gun, modern fire control systems, arrow-shaped armor, spaced armor, and possibly third-generation subsystems..
The Jaguar is The Jaguar was a prototype vehicle based on the Type 59 chassis that was jointly developed by the United States and China during the 1980s, made possible by the US-Chinese détente of the 1970s. Planned to replace China's existing tank fleet, as well as for the export market, the tank featured improvements to the standard Type 59's engine, armament, armor, turret, optics, electronics, fire control, and suspension. Following Tiananmen Square massacre, American-Chinese relations soured and the Chinese withdrew from the project. The Americans continued alone and successfully completed the design, however, the end of the Cold War saw a glut in the international tank market, and thus no orders were ever placed for the vehicle..
The Type 62 Light Tank is In the late 1950s, the PLA submitted requirements for a light tank more suitable for operations in China's southern region. Development on the new Type 62 tank began in 1958, which was a scaled-down Type 59 MBT with simplified equipment. The Type 62 light tank entered batch production in 1963, and approx. 800 were produced by 1978. The Type 62 light tank weighs only 21 tons and is equipped with a Type 62-85TC 85 mm rifled gun, and 3 machine guns. An improved Type 62-I version was produced with better FCS with laser rangefinder and turret storage racks for added protection. Other versions based on the Type 62 include the Type 79 recovery vehicle (prototype only) and Type 82 earth-mover.

The PLA deployed the Type 62 light tank to Vietnam during the 1979 Sino-Vietnam conflict. They found that the thin armor of the Type 62 tank could be penetrated easily by hand-held anti-tank weapons, such as the 40 mm RPG. The Type 62 tank suffered severe losses during the conflict, which convinced the PLA to develop new second-generation MBTs. The Type 62 tank received a major upgrade in 2000, with a new welded turret, vertically stabilized 105 mm rifled gun, fire-control system, night vision device, smoke grenade launchers, and explosive reactive armor (ERA) package..
The Type 69 / 79 is Improved Type 59 MBT built by 617 Factory (Inner Mongolia First Machine Group Co. Ltd). Only saw limited service in the PLA, but was an export success in the 1980s with more than 2,000 sold worldwide..
The Type 73 is This armored recovery vehicle is a Type 59 with its turret removed. The vehicle is armed with a single 12.7 mm machine gun. This armored recovery vehicle is not believed to have a winch and is limited to towing operations..
The Type 59 Heavy Infantry Fighting Vehicle is The modernized HIFV model of Type 59 weighs around 40 tons and can carry up to seven passengers. Modifications include moving the engine to the front of the vehicle chassis, increasing tank armor including explosive reactive armor on all sides, and installing a rear door for dismounting infantry..
The QN-506 is It is a modernized variant of the Type 59 using the tank's chassis similar to its Russian counterpart the BMPT Terminator. The vehicle was first appeared at the Zhuhai Air Show in China in November 2018 and is armed with two QN-502C anti-tank missiles, ten QN-201 multi-purpose mini-missiles, four S-507 loitering munitions, an unmanned 30 mm cannon, a 7.62 mm machine gun, six grenade launchers, and a quadcopter surveillance drone..
The Type T-72Z is Iran version..
The Kok'san is North Korea version..
The Al-Zarrar is Pakistan version.  Heavy Industries Taxila of Pakistan has introduced the Al-Zarrar Main Battle Tank. The Al-Zarrar series was designed to improve and rebuild the Pakistani army's Type 59 tanks by way of more modern armament, fire control, defensive equipment, etc. Improvements include:
