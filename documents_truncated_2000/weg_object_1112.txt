This document describes the Udaloy Class (Project 1155 Fregat Class) Russian Anti-Submarine Guided-Missile Destroyer.

The Udaloy class, Russian designations Project 1155 Fregat and Project 11551 Fregat-M (Russian: Фрегат, 'Fregat' meaning Frigate), are a series of anti-submarine guided-missile destroyers built for the Soviet Navy, seven of which are currently in service with the Russian Navy. Twelve ships were built between 1980 and 1991, while the thirteenth ship built to a modified design, known as the Udaloy II class, followed in 1999. They complement the Sovremennyy-class destroyers in anti-aircraft and anti-surface warfare operations. The codename Udaloy comes from an archaic Russian adjective удалой, meaning daring or bold.  The ships were built as general-purpose destroyers with emphasis on ASW. Construction stopped at 12 units. This class saw relatively little operational use during the 1990s because of the difficulty in obtaining spare gas turbines, which had to be imported from Ukraine.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
