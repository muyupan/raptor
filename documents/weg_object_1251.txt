This document describes the S-300P (SA-10 Grumble) Russian 8x8 Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System.

The S-300P (transliterated from Russian С-300П, NATO reporting name SA-10 Grumble) is the original version of the S-300 system which became operational in 1978. In 1987, over 80 of these sites were active, mainly in the area around Moscow. The P suffix stands for PVO-Strany (country air defense system). An S-300PT unit consists of a 36D6 (NATO reporting name TIN SHIELD) surveillance radar, a 30N6 (FLAP LID) fire control system, and 5P85-1 launch vehicles. The 5P85-1 vehicle is a semi-trailer truck. Usually, a 76N6 (CLAMSHELL) low altitude detection radar is also a part of the unit.

This system broke substantial new ground, including the use of a passive electronically scanned array radar and multiple engagements on the same Fire-control system (FCS). Nevertheless, it had some limitations. It took over one hour to set up this semi-mobile system for firing and the hot vertical launch method employed scorched the TEL.


9S32 engagement radar
It was originally intended to fit the Track Via Missile (TVM) guidance system onto this model. However, the TVM system had problems tracking targets below 500 m. Rather than accept the limitation, the Soviets decided that the tracking of low altitude targets was a must and decided to use a pure command-guidance system until the TVM head was ready. This allowed the minimum engagement altitude to be set at 25 m.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Greece, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Viet Nam.

Here is Variants information for the S-300P (SA-10 Grumble) Russian 8x8 Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System:
The S-300P (NATO: SA-10A Grumble A) is The S-300P (transliterated from Russian С-300П, NATO reporting name SA-10 Grumble) is the original version of the S-300 system which became operational in 1978.[1] In 1987, over 80 of these sites were active, mainly in the area around Moscow. The P suffix stand for PVO-Strany (country air defence system). An S-300PT unit consists of a 36D6 (NATO reporting name TIN SHIELD) surveillance radar, a 30N6 (FLAP LID) fire control system and 5P85-1 launch vehicles. The 5P85-1 vehicle is a semi-trailer truck. Usually a 76N6 (CLAM SHELL) low altitude detection radar is also a part of the unit..
The S-300PS (NATO: SA-10B Grumble B) is was introduced in 1985 and is the only version thought to have been fitted with a nuclear warhead. This model saw the introduction of the modern TEL and mobile radar and command-post vehicles that were all based on the MAZ-7910 8 × 8 truck.[1] This model also featured the new 5V55R missiles which increased maximum engagement range to 90 km (56 mi) and introduced a terminal semi-active radar homing (SARH) guidance mode. The surveillance radar of these systems was designated 30N6. Also introduced with this version was the distinction between self-propelled and towed TELs. The towed TEL is designated 5P85T. Mobile TELs were the 5P85S and 5P85D. The 5P85D was a "slave" TEL, being controlled by a 5P85S "master" TEL. The "master" TEL is identifiable thanks to the large equipment container behind the cabin; in the "slave" TEL this area is not enclosed and is used for cable or spare tyre storage..
The S-300PMU (NATO: SA-10B Grumble) is The third generation of the S-300P system was the S-300PMU (U for Usovershenstvovanniy, meaning finalised). The S-300PMU programme was intended to provide an enhanced mobility version of the system to replace obsolete PVO missile systems with the forward-deployed groups of forces in Europe..
The S-300PM (NATO: SA-20A Gargoyle) is The S-300PM (M for Modernizovanniy, meaning modernised) underwent an extensive modernisation package with design changes to almost all the key components of the earlier S-300P variants. Essentially the advancements were based on the S-300PS and S-300PMU (described after the S-300PM here), but it also incorporated improvements in the missile round design and upgrades in the radar system..
The S-300PMU-1 (NATO: SA- 20A Gargoyle) is The S-300PMU-1 is an export version of S-300PM. It differs from the earlier S-300PMU in using the 30N6E1 ‘Tomb Stone’, having updated technology in all major systems and a significant update of the software used in its fire control systems. The S-300PMU-1 system has a capability to intercept ballistic missiles with ranges of 600 km, with the intercepts taking place at ranges up to 40 km from the launcher..
The S-300PMU-2 (NATO: SA-20B Gargoyle) is The S-300PMU-2 is the most advanced S-300P system and evolved from major technology upgrades to the S-300PM and S-300PMU-1. The system also incorporated technology migration from the concurrent development of the more advanced S-400 (40RCE) system, enabling easy integration of the S-300PMU-2 into the newer technology and networked framework of the S-400 systems..
The Favorit-S (NATO: SA-20B Gargoyle) is INA.
