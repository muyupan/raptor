This document describes the R-438M Belozer Russian Mobile Satellite Communication Station.

The station is designed to provide satellite radio communications for units operating detached  from the main forces, as well as for use as a commanderâ€™s personal station. It provides a full autonomy of operation transmitting voice, digital, and text messages, automated functional testing, and interface with a wide range of peripheral devices through ports RS-232C, C1-FL-BI. The radio station can be carried by one person.

Mode of work:

Duplex telecommunication;

Simplex data communication;

Formalized service communication mode;

Transfer rates of 1200 bps;

Two channel receiving mode.

As compared to the stations of the previous generation, the data speed has increased by several times. On the move, the station is the size of a school backpack and can be carried by one person; it weighs 16 kg. Set up time is about 30 sec. The station provides formalized service communication and a secure telephone mode. The station operates in the range of 4 GHz to 6 GHz. Data transfer rate is 1200 bps. The advantages of satellite communication are a large range of reliable signals, especially in  areas with difficult terrain, regardless of the weather conditions and time of day and year, and a highly secure protection. Yaroslavl Radio Manufacturing Plant started production of the portable satellite radio station R-438 Barrier-T in 1998-2000 and the R-438M Belozer in 2002-2003.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
