This document describes the RPG-27 Tavolga Russian Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher.

The RPG-27 shares a close resemblance with the previous RPG-26 in that it is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single shot capacity. The RPG-27 has a larger diameter round than the RPG-26 which enables the RPG-27 to achieve higher armor penetration performance. The RPG-27 fin-stabilized round is a 105 mm tandem-charge HEAT warhead with a range of 200 meters. The round has a stated penetration capability in excess of 600 mm of RHA (after ERA) and 1500 mm of brick or concrete and 3700 mm of earth. The RShG-1 is very similar in operation to the RPG-27 but carries a thermobaric warhead with a lethal radius of 10 meters and a larger range of 600 meters. Officially adopted by the Russian Government in December 2011.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Mexico, Russian Federation, Syria.

Here is Variants information for the RPG-27 Tavolga Russian Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher:
The RMG Variant is The RMG is a smaller, multipurpose variant of the RShG-1 that is optimized for the bunker buster role and defeating light vehicles and infantry in cover. As a result, its penetration performance against tank armor is reduced.

The launcher carries a tandem warhead. The precursor high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead penetrates armor or other obstacles (reinforced concrete, masonry, etc.). The main warhead creates a fine explosive cloud and takes into the interior through the hole, pierced by the precursor charge. Detonation of the main warhead explosive boasts a multiple effects (high-explosive and incendiary).

The RMG rocket launcher ('RMG' stands for “Reaktivnaya Mnogotselevaya Granata” or rocket-propelled multi-purpose grenade) was developed by Bazalt in the early 2000s. As is the case with disposable anti-tank rocket launchers and multi-purpose assault weapons, the designation of the new rocket launcher is the designation of its round. The design project was supervised by leading designer S. Kh. Irtuganov. Officially adopted by the Russian Government in December 2011..
The RSHG-1 is The 105 mm RShG‐1 multi‐purpose rocket launcher is a variant of the RPG‐27 firing a revised rocket projectile GRAU index 7P51 (7П51) with a unitary thermobaric warhead, the same as used on the TBG‐7. The range is extended out to 600 m..
