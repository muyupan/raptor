This document describes the Wolei Class (Type 918 Class) Chinese Minelayer.

The Wolei Class (Type 918 Class) Chinese Minelayer advantage over other platforms in that it can lay conformal mines, i.e. mines with irregular shapes instead of ordinary cylindrical and spherical shapes, and conformal mines are much harder to detect and identify. The mine laying process is fully computerized and both the hardware and software have been upgraded to accommodate new weapons and tactics. In addition to laying mines, the ship is also extensively equipped for use as a supply ship and has been deployed in supply missions much more frequently than as a minelayer.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
