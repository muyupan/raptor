This document describes the K-200 KIFV South Korean Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The K-200 KIFV (Korea Infantry Fighting Vehicle) is a South Korean armored personnel carrier, originally produced by Daewoo Heavy Industries as a domestic replacement for older armored personnel carriers, such as the M113, in front line service with the Republic of Korea Armed Forces at the time of the K-200's development. Since 2009 the K200 has been supplemented by the K21. A total of 2,383 K-200 vehicles of all configurations were produced between 1985 and 2006, among which are 111 K200A1 vehicles exported to Malaysia.

The K-200 series of vehicles transport mechanized infantry platoon is designed to keep personnel safe from small arms fire. The hull of the KIFV is of all-welded aluminum armor with an additional layer of spaced laminate steel armor bolted to it. This composite armor provides a higher level of protection for less weight. It can protect against 12.7 mm on the side and 7.62 mm on the rear, and against anti-personnel mines. The engine compartment is located at the front right of the vehicle and is separated from the remainder of the vehicle by a bulkhead. The engine compartment is fitted with a fire extinguishing system that can be operated by the driver or from outside the vehicle. 
The K-200 has six electrically operated smoke grenade launchers mounted across the front of the hull as countermeasures against electro-optical and infrared targeting. If the KIFV variant features a turret, the smoke grenade launchers mounted on the turret (three on each side).

K-200 can provide infantry firepower support with 12.7 mm and 7.62 mm machine guns. Stronger anti-infantry and anti-material firepower can be brought to bear by equipping a 20 mm Vulcan gun, or 81 mm and 107 mm mortars. Anti-tank capability can be added by equipping the Metis-M anti-tank missile system. The K200 is highly modular, and its variants provide additional combat supports such as air defense and vehicle recovery by outfitting many different types of equipment. The vehicles accommodate 12 people including one infantry squad, the driver, and gunners.

In November 2015, Doosan and CMI Defence revealed they had joined to create the Cockerill Protected Weapon Station (CPWS) to increase the firepower of the K200. The turret can support cannons between 20–30 mm, plus a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun, including the: CPWS20 20 mm; CPWS 25 mm which can be armed with the M242 Bushmaster, Nexter M811, or Oerlikon KBA; and CPWS30 armed with the M230LF.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Malaysia, South Korea (Republic of Korea).
