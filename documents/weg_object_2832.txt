This document describes the TBR-115 Chinese VHF transceiver.

The TBR-115 Chinese VHF transceiver  is a result of Sino-American technology transfer taken place in early 80s during so-called “Honeymoon” period. It is modeled after Racal 4720 and is designed to equip battalion-company- platoon level commanding personal in infantry, artillery, airborne and marine units, replacing 861(A), 862(A), 823, 7011 transceivers and other similar radios. It also could communicate with 861, 823, 884, 7011 and other transceiver working within its frequency range. With the technology transfer, design work was started in mid 80s and the machine was certified in early 90s, likely in 1992. It is still current PLA equipment as of 2008. However, TBR-115 is starting to phase out of PLA front line units.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
