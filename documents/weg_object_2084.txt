This document describes the NSV Russian 12.7mm Heavy Machine Gun.

The NSV (Russian НСВ Никитина-Соколова-Волкова), also known as the «Utyos» (Project: Lonely Cliff), is a 12.7mm caliber heavy machine gun of Soviet origin, named after the designers, G. I. Nikitin (Г. И. Никитин), Y. S. Sokolov (Ю. М. Соколов) and V. I. Volkov (В. И. Волков). It was designed to replace the DShK machine gun and was adopted by the Soviet Army in 1971. It is no longer being produced in Russia; the manufacturing license for the NSV ended up in Kazakhstan after the break-up of the Soviet Union. The NSV has been manufactured in Bulgaria, India, Poland, and Yugoslavia under license.

The NSV weighs 25 kg (55 lb), has a rate of fire of 700–800 rounds per minute, and an effective range from 1,500 m (1,600 yd) to 2,000 m (2,200 yd) against airborne and ground targets, respectively. A loaded ammunition belt with 50 rounds weighs 11 kg (24 lb).


The Soviet Army began looking for a new heavy machine gun to replace its older SGM and DShK machine guns in the early 1950s. The Soviet Army liked the idea behind the German MG 42; a versatile weapon used on a variety of mounts to perform many different roles. Two Soviet weapon designers were asked to design one weapon each utilizing the same principle.

Testing approved Mikhail Kalashnikov's solution; it was found to be more reliable and cheaper to manufacture than the design of Grigory Nikitin and Yuri Sokolov. Kalashnikov's machine gun became the new standard machine gun and was named PK.

Nikitin's and Sokolov's design was however not forgotten. It was developed into the heavy NSV machine gun about 10 years later and selected in 1969 as the successor to the DShK/DShKM machine gun. It was accepted in service by the Soviet Army in 1971. The machine gun was also license-manufactured in Bulgaria, India, Yugoslavia, and Poland. The Yugoslavian version of the NSVT is called the M87.

Production of the NSV has ended in Russia, and it is currently being replaced by the Kord-heavy machine gun. The Russian Army needed a more accurate heavy machine gun, and it has also been increasingly difficult to get hold of spare parts. NSV production was located in Ukraine and in Kazakhstan and was disrupted by the end of the Soviet Union.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Djibouti, Egypt, Finland, Georgia, India, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mongolia, Namibia, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Poland, Russian Federation, Serbia, Sierra Leone, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Syria, Ukraine, Viet Nam.

(.50-cal) ammunition.
.
The Kord is A Russian modernized version of the NSV/NSVT. Improvements include reduced weight (50% for hand-carry 6P57), reduced recoil, increased barrel life,
improved reliability, improved accuracy, increased burst rate capacity, and improved reliability and maintenance. Reduced weight and recoil permits use with the 6T19 light machinegun bipod. Like the above Russian MGs, the Kord can be produced in either ammunition version.
Vehicle version is 6P49. Swivel mount hand-operated versions are 6P58 and 6P59.
