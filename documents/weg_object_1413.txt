This document describes the Type 094 Class (Jin Class) Chinese Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine.

The Type 094 Class (Jin Class) Chinese Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine (SSBN) is a class of ballistic missile submarine developed by China for the People's Liberation Army Navy Submarine Force. Type 094 succeeds the Type 092 submarine.

The Type 094 was first spotted in 2006 on commercial satellite imagery of the Xiaopingdao Submarine Base. It was noted as being longer than Type 092. Two Type 094s were spotted at the Bohai Shipyard in May 2007, although it was not clear if these included the one spotted in 2006.

One was operational in 2010, three in 2013, and four in 2015. As many as eight may enter service by 2020.

The PRC is interested in augmenting its ICBM forces with SSBNs to enhance its comprehensive nuclear deterrent force. Nuclear deterrent patrols commenced in December 2015.

Type 094 is armed with 12 JL-2 SLBMs, each with an estimated range of 7,400 km (4,600 mi). Each missile carries one warhead. The Type 094 and JL-2 are China's first credible sea-based nuclear deterrent.

Globalsecurity.org notes that a Type 094 patrolling just northeast of the Kuril Islands would be able to strike three-quarters of the contiguous United States; whereas launching from Chinese coastal waters would barely reach the Aleutian Islands. Thomas-Noone and Medcalf note that the Type 094's noisiness would make it difficult for it to reach and maintain patrol areas where it could strike at the contiguous United States; no such limitations would exist against Indian targets.

Type 094 (Western reporting name Jin-class) is a Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine (SSBN). It is the second-generation SSBN of the Chinese navy. Development possibly began in the early 1980s. It is a successor to the unreliable sole Type 092 or Xia class boat, which was a catalog of disasters and had little strategic value. The whole development project of the Type 094 class is kept in secrecy.

   Speculations have been made, that development of the Type 094 class was assisted by Russian Rubin Design Bureau, however, this information was not confirmed. Construction of the lead vessel began in 1999 and it was launched in 2004. It seems that the first boat was commissioned in 2010. The second boat of the class was launched in 2007. Some sources claim that these Chinese ballistic missile submarines were plagued with various problems and design flaws. As of 2018 China operates 4 of these ballistic missile submarines. This fact was also confirmed by a US Department of Defense report. It is believed that at least one of these boats was completed to an improved project, which is sometimes referred to as Type 094A. These boats are deployed on the Longpo naval base on Hainan island. These ballistic missile boats form China's sea-based nuclear deterrent capability.

   By 2018 Jin-class boats were never sent on long-range deterrent patrol missions, possibly due to various problems and design flaws. Instead, these boats are patrolling in the South China Sea, relatively close to China's coastal waters. The South China Sea is becoming a bastion for Chinese SSBN operations.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the Type 094 Class (Jin Class) Chinese Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine:
The Type 094A is The Type 094A is a variant with a modified and improved sail. The sail appears to incorporate features from one installed on a modified Type 093..

Here is System information for the Type 094 Class (Jin Class) Chinese Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine:
The Alternative Designation is Type 094 Class; Jin Class.
The Type is Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine (SSBN).
The Builder is Bohai Shipyard, Huludao, China.

The Crew is 140+.
The Note is Once on high alert these submarines can leave their bases and operate in China's coastal water, protected by China's fleet. So the Jin-class boats have a high probability of surviving the first strike, once the country has been attacked.  However, these submarines are not as advanced or stealthy as the Western ballistic missile submarines. Furthermore, these are even inferior to the Russian submarines. China was always dragging behind in terms of submarine technology. It was reported that the Type 094 class boats are as noisy as the Russian Delta III class submarines, which were adopted back in the mid-1970s..
