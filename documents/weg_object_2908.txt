This document describes the Slovakian Decontamination/Smoke Generator Vehicle TZ-74.

THE TZ-74 IS PRIMARILY USED FOR THE DECONTAMINATION OF VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT WHETHER STATIONARY OR ON THE MOVE. ADDITIONALLY, THE SYSTEM CAN BE USED TO DECONTAMINATE GROUND AND HARD SURFACE ROADS AS WELL AS PRODUCE PROTECTIVE SMOKESCREENS. THE TZ-74 IS BASED ON THE CHASSIS OF THE TATRA 148 PPR 15, 6X6 TRUCKS. THE SYSTEM USES A GAS TURBINE ENGINE TO GENERATE A SMOKE SCREEN OVER A LARGE AREA. THE GAS TURBINE IS MOUNTED ON THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE WITH THE OPERATOR’S CABIN ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE, AND AN OBSCURANT TANK ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE. THE REMAINDER OF THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE CONSISTS OF STORAGE TANKS FOR
LIQUIDS AND FUEL FOR THE TURBINE ENGINE. A SMOKESCREEN IS CREATED AS A RESULT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF OIL, DIESEL FUEL, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH INTO THE EXHAUST NOZZLE OF THE TURBINE ENGINE. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MIXTURE INTO THE TURBINE ENGINES EXHAUST CAUSES AN IMMEDIATE DISPERSION AND EVAPORATION OF THE MIXTURE THAT CONDENSES IN THE COOLER PART OF THE STREAM AFTER EXPULSION FROM THE MOTOR. THE TZ-74 CAN PRODUCE SMOKE IN ABOUT A MINUTE AFTER THE TURBINE ENGINE IS TURNED ON. ALTHOUGH THE JET ENGINE HAS ENOUGH FUEL TO OPERATE FOR 3 HOURS, ITS MISSION TIME IS SEVERELY LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE INTERNAL LIQUID SOURCES AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, IF EXTERNAL SOURCES ARE USED, THE MISSION TIMES ARE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. THE MAIN DECONTAMINANT TANK HAS A 5,000-LITER CAPACITY. THE FOG OIL TANK HAS A 200-LITER CAPACITY. THE FUEL TANK FOR THE GAS TURBINE HAS A 2,000-LITER CAPACITY.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Czech Republic.
