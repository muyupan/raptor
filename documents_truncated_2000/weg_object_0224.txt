This document describes the C-801 Chinese Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile.

The C-801 is the export version of the YJ-8. The C-801 was not marketed after 2003.
The YJ-8  (NATO reporting name: CSS-N-4 Sardine) is a Chinese surface-launched subsonic anti-ship cruise missile. It is manufactured by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) Third Academy.

The YJ-8 was developed into air-launched (YJ-81) and submarine-launched (YJ-82) variants.

The YJ-8 is either based on or is a heavily modified copy of, the MM38 Exocet; the two missiles share virtually identical operational profiles. The replication of the MM38's "revolutionary flight profile" in less than ten years and with an immature industrial base strongly suggests that China had access to proven technology.

The YJ-8 was a "radical departure" from China's first anti-ship missiles derived from the P-15 Termit. The YJ-8 carried a smaller warhead but had the same range and speed while being significantly smaller and lighter.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Myanmar, Thailand, Yemen.
