This document describes the GCT (AUF1) French 155mm Self-Propelled Gun (SPG).

The AUF1 is a French self-propelled gun vehicle currently in use by the armies of France, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait. It replaced the Mk F3 155mm in French army service. The AUF1 primary advancement is that it incorporates and provides full armor and nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protection for its crew of four, while the Mk F3 155mm offered no protection and could carry only two of its four crew members.  The AUF1 saw combat with the Iraqi Army in the Iran–Iraq War.
A four-man gun crew can reload the AUF1 in 15 minutes. A two-man gun crew can reload the AUF1 in 20 minutes.
The AUF1T is fitted with the "Sagem Cita 20" inertial navigation system as well as a 20-24 HP gas turbine auxiliary power unit (APU). 
The production ended in 1995, and the 155 GCT (standing for “Grande Cadence de Tir”, which can be translated to High Rate of Fire), like its predecessor, was largely exported to Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, with 427 built-in total. The 155 GCT saw service during the Iran-Iraq war, the invasion of Kuwait, both Gulf Wars, and in Yugoslavia.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: France, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia.
