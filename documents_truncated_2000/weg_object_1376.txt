This document describes the Type 903 Class (Fuchi Class) Chinese Replenishment Ship.

In 1996 the Thai Navy ordered the "Similan" supply ship. The ship started in 1997 mainly for serving Thai Navy's light aircraft carrier and resupply convoy. "Similan" was built by China, with a full load displacement of 23,000 tons, the hull has two central depot systems, either oil-water supplies can also be dry supplies. For vertical replenishment, a helicopter deck and hangar were installed in the rear of the ship. The ship can carry 9,000 tons of oil and water, ammunition, and other supplies.

Once the start of construction of the Fuqing-class supply ship had already passed a quarter of a century, the Chinese finally began construction at the Shanghai East shipyard in 2002 of a new naval supply ship, similar to the Thai Navy's "Similan". Fu Chi class and "Similan" was both hull shape, the main structure is very similar. In fact, according to "Jane's warships Yearbook)), the two main hull dimensions are basically the same. Of course, onboard equipment is different. , Fu Chi class and "Similan" was the same size as the main hull, but the stern of different shapes, probably because of the helicopter deck equipment is not the same.

The shape of the hull below the waterline and the hull structure may largely follow the "Similan" sign design. Because in the midships also designed the porthole, there may be a considerable portion of installed residential facilities. From the exterior view, Fu Chi class supply ship, including the bridge, helicopter base, and superstructure rear chimney larger, distinct from "Similan" was an almost complete absence of other large porthole design differences. Fu Chi class and "Similan" was installed in the same location in two groups maritime depot system, but with the latter two groups are oil and water, dry dual-use staging systems, Fu Chi class the oil depot system is front mounted, the rear is a dry goods depot system. In addition, the Fu Chi-grade oil depot system and the "Nacang" use the same model.

On 29 March 2003 the PLA launched a newly designed AOR, Qiandaohu No. 886, at which time a second was reported building. Initially, it was suggested that the ships were probably from the Dalian Shipyard, but later sources report they were from Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai. Her sister ship Weishanhu (887) was built by Huangpu Shipyard based in Guangzhou. The first-of-class was commissioned by the East Sea Fleet in April 2004. The second hull was launched in June 2003 and commissioned by the South Sea Fleet in late 2004. This class of ship was given the reporting name Fuchi class by NATO.

The ships are 171 meters long and displacing 22,000 tons at full load, with an armament of two Type 76A 37mm twin guns. The new oiler are of the same design as the Similan class (Hudong-Type R22T, named after the Similan Islands National Park off Thailand's West Coast, the best diving in Thailand) built for the Royal Thai Navy in 1995, and is comparable to the smaller French DURANCE class AOR. Like the Similan oiler, the ship has a flight deck and a hangar for one helicopter. The No. 886 class is powered by two license-built French-designed SEMT-Pielstick 12,000 brake-horsepower [BHP] diesel engines.

The pair of new No. 886 class AORs brought to five the total number of PLA Navy underway supply ships. The new class followed the Fuqing class, of which two units were built, and was needed to support the new Guangzhou-class (Type 052B/C) destroyers.

Japan increased its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) out to 200 miles around its islands in 1996, and it overlapped China's EEZ in this area. After that began a noticeable increase in Chinese warships, research vessels and oil exploration vessels operating in and around the EEZ. China escalated its visibility when it sent a Sovremenny-Class ship, the most modern PLAN warship, into the waters of the Chunxiao oil-field on January 22, 2005. There was further escalation in September 2005 when a task group of five ships cruised Japanese EEZ oil-field waters. The flagship was Sovremenny hull 137, accompanied by Jianghu frigates 515 and 517, the 23,000-ton replenishment support ship Fuchi hull 886 and the 6,000-ton space event/intelligence ship Dongdiao, which bore hull number 851. Donadio, was hull number 232 when it intruded in 2000, indicating that Dongdiao had moved from the East Sea Fleet to the North Sea Fleet.

Then in 2008, these ships became heavily used, supporting 13 task forces sent to the anti-piracy patrol off Somalia. Usually, one Type 903 accompanied two warships (usually a frigate and a destroyer), supplying fuel, water, food, and other supplies as needed. The replenishment ship would go to local ports to restock its depleted stores of fuel, water, food, and other necessities.

China needed more Type 903s to support the growing number of long distance training operations into the Western Pacific. One new Type 903 was launched in March 2012, and a second one two months later. Both underwent fitting out and sea trials. The first one launched in 2012 completed trials in nine months and the second one was apparently on the same fast track. Both Type 903s entered service in 2013.

China launched another Type 903 replenishment ship in mid-2013, around the same time the third one completed its first sea trials. China built and put into the water three more Type 903 replenishment ships in less than two years. A supply ship was commissioned for the East China Sea fleet of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy on 12 September 2013. The supply ship Chaohu is a Chinese-made ocean-going vessel capable of replenishing both dry and liquid cargo, said Zhang Weidong, the ship's captain. The ship, with hull number 890, successfully completed supply missions to two naval vessels during a trial voyage conducted recently, according to military sources. Chaohu has a displacement of more than 20,000 tons and is able to sail to all kinds of sea areas except polar and ice regions, according to Zhang.

Early 903 combined a number of Russian-made supply equipment, including the key horizontal supply system; the system by the Chinese Navy General Equipment Department and Russia contact, technical and price negotiations, by the China Poly Company is responsible for the purchase. Russia in addition to providing horizontal supply device, but also put forward the appearance of the supply mast and the force diagram, as well as the supply tank of the outline. The second batch of 903 type built in the 1920s (see below) began to use the Chinese-made horizontal supply device, and the first batch of 903 will also switch to domestic horizontal supply device.

Compared with Thailand's Similan, 903 type of front and rear ship structure volume are slightly expanded, these signs show 903 type of living space after the increase, so speculation 903 also have to accommodate the command staff and personnel transport function; In addition, the structure of the 903 and the tin milan below the helicopter deck is also different. And the same number of the South warehouse, 903 is also equipped with a number of medical facilities and maintenance factories, both medical and repair ship part of the function. And China's second-line service ships the same, 903-type superstructure is also full of square portholes (tin Milano no). It is noteworthy that the tinmilan previously built for Thailand in order to tie in with the same period Thailand to Spain to buy light ship, and China from the beginning of 2000 began to plan to build aircraft carrier, so the 903 type of internal support configuration may Has been considered to the needs of the ship combat group.

903-type tail with a helicopter library and flight deck, can carry a Russian-made Ka-27 transport helicopters, or two straight -9 helicopters, effective vertical filling operations. In addition, the tin milan on both sides of the stern are equipped with a boat pendant, 903 type is increased to two side of each boat pylon. Armed, the 903 has a four-door 76F double-mounted 37mm 63-speed fast gun, respectively, located in front of both sides of the bridge and helicopters on both sides of the top. Compared with the Fuqing level 76, 903 type 76F improved, with a closed turret cover, with automatic and manual operation of the two models, the maximum firing rate of 180 rounds / min, a range of 8.5km, but the ship is not set up supporting Of the radiation control radar (may only be equipped with a simple optical electronic control system), so the lack of night combat capability.

On March 22, 2012, Guangzhou Shipbuilding International built the third 903 type ship. The hangar was significantly larger than the original. At the beginning of 2012, pictures on the Internet showed that the Guangzhou Shipyard International Shipyard began construction of a new oil-oil supply ship, launched on March 22, 2012, its appearance is clearly 903 type of follow-up model, called 903A, the overall configuration was roughly the same, with many details and equipment improved, the appearance can be found in the helicopter door widened, can accommodate more helicopters; the original four 76A dual-mounted 37mm cannon also replaced by four in China in the early 2010 H / PJ-17 30mm cannon (see 056 frigate one), the ship was named Taihu Lake (889); and in the same period, Shanghai and Shanghai also built a homogeneous supply ship, and in May 7, 2012 The water was named Nest Lake (890). Taihu Lake on June 18, 2013 entered the North Sea Fleet service, Chaohu No. in September 12, 2013 into the East China Sea Fleet service.

On 31 May 2014, the People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) fifth Fuchi class Type 903A replenishment ship was launched at the Guangzhou International Shipyard in Guangzhou, China. With a 23,000 ton displacement capable of carrying 11,000 tons of supplies, the Type 903 class is China's most modern and largest indigenous replenishment oiler ship*, which resupplies warships at sea with fuel and other supplies. This 903A ship still needs to be fitted out with refueling and cross ship transfer conveyer belts. The Fuchi class's ability to transfer fuel and dry supplies to warships on the high seas in Underway Replenishment (UNREP) missions means that PLAN warships can remain on patrol instead of returning to port for fuel and food.

With the continuous service of large and medium-sized combat ships, the Chinese navy had a large number of ocean going vessels to supply and security capabilities put forward higher requirements, a large number of construction of new integrated supply ship has become a reasonable choice. On 27 December 2015, hull number 960 "Dongping Lake" ship formally entered service, so far, the Chinese Navy active duty 903A supply ship has reached 3 ships. According to the internet pictures, a follow-up of at least 3 ships with the type of ship in service, plus two aircraft 903 basic type, in shortly before July 15, 2016 China designed manufacturing new offshore supply ship Honghu ship, ship Luoma Lake into the column naming ceremony held at a naval base in Zhanjiang, Guangdong. Since then, two offshore supply ship officially joined the Navy South Sea Fleet battle sequence, but also marked the people's navy ability to carry out tasks.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
