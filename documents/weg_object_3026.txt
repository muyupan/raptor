This document describes the Mi-26 (Halo) Russian Heavy Transport Helicopter.

The Mil Mi-26 (Russian: Миль Ми-26, NATO reporting name: Halo) is a Soviet/Russian heavy transport helicopter. Its product code is izdeliye 90. Operated by both military and civilian operators, it is the largest and most powerful helicopter to have gone into series production.

The Mi-26 helicopter, the heaviest and most powerful helicopter in the world, was designed for carrying large-sized cargoes weighing up to 20 tons. It is the result of an early 1970s specification for a transport helicopter whose empty weight, without fuel, was not to exceed half of its maximum take-off weight. It can be used for construction projects ranging from bridges to power transmission lines. The combination of high load-carrying capacity and high cruise speed makes the use of the helicopter economically efficient.

The helicopter is loaded through the cargo hatch in the tail of the fuselage with lowered ladder and sub ladders. The cargo cabin is equipped with two electric hoists and lifting and loading devices ensuring loading and carrying along with the cabin of cargoes weighing up to 5 tons. Mil Moscow helicopter plant joint-stock company is the major designer and producer of military transport, civil transport, heavy-lift,multi-role helicopters. Mil is associated with the Rostov and Kazan production enterprises. Rostov makes the Mi-26 heavy-lift helicopters.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Belarus, Cambodia, CFE Treaty, China, Equatorial Guinea, India, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Peru, Russian Federation, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).
