This document describes the 1L260 Zoopark-1M Russian Mobile Counter-Battery Radar.

The 1L260 Zoopark-1M is mobile artillery locating radar system designed to detect artillery rocket positions even in heavy electronic countermeasures (ECM) environments. Besides, the 1L260 can detect mortar and howitzer gunfire sources as well as tactical ballistic missiles launch pads. The radar system is mounted on a tracked armored chassis and includes a maintenance vehicle. Besides, the system can provide assistance for friendly artillery systems helping them to adjust their gunfire to effectively hit their designated target. The 1L260 radar system can detect a 155mm artillery shell at a range of 23 kilometers or 27 kilometers for 203mm shells. It can detect artillery rockets at ranges between 32 and 45 kilometers. An ATACMS-sized tactical ballistic missile can be detected at a range of 65 kilometers. The 1L260 can be ready for deployment or evacuation in five minutes while operating for over eight hours tracking up to 12 targets simultaneously. In azimuth, it covers a sector of 2.5 to 90-degree.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
