This document describes the Berkut-2 Russian Tactical Heated-Cab Snowmobile.

The Berkut-2, or TTM-1901-40, is an extremely simple vehicle consisting of a small heated 2-man cab built atop a set of forward articulated sleds and tracks in the rear. A PKP GPMG can be mounted just behind the cab but there is no armor to protect the gunner or cab. The Berkut’s small size and light weight, just 900kg or just under 2,000 lbs, make it ideal for rapid transport aboard trucks or transport aircraft.

Highly versatile, the snowmobiles can tow up to 650 lb or 295 kg – either equipment or troops on skis/sleds pulled by tether. The cabs are heated and can support operations in temperatures as low as -55F or -50C. The vehicles are ideal for patrolling or transporting troops to difficult, heavily wooded areas, when insertion on foot or by air are impractical.

Snowmobiles are a part of Russia’s renewed interest in the Arctic region with the refurbishment and reactivation of former bases in the Russian Arctic Circle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

The Aircraft Transport Capable is Many of Russia’s military transport aircraft, such as the Il-76, could easily carry them internally and An-32 or An-76 tactical airlifters may be able to as well. Helicopters such as the Mi-8/17 could carry them sling-loaded or even possibly inside their cabin. This could also make the Berkuts an attractive way to provide additional mobility for airborne or special operations forces inserted in remote Arctic areas for short-duration missions..
