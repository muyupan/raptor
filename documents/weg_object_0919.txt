This document describes the Mi-24 (Hind) Russian Attack Helicopter.

Mil Mi-24 is a twin-engined Combat helicopter intended for close support of ground forces, destruction of armored targets, and transportation of persons or cargo. The Mi-24 is not a direct counterpart to the American AH-64 Apache, since unlike this and other Western attack helicopters it is also capable of transporting up to eight troops. As a combination of gunship and troop transport, the Hind combat helicopter has no direct NATO counterpart.

The combat helicopter is a flying infantry fighting vehicle, which blends features of both transport and attack helicopters. Soviet pilots called the aircraft 'letayushiy tank' or flying tank. Another common nickname is 'Krokodil' (Crocodile) - due to the helicopter's camouflage and fuselage shape and "Drinking Glass", (Stakan) because of the flat glass plates that surround the Mi-24's cockpit.

The core of the aircraft was derived from the Mil Mi-8 (NATO reporting name "Hip") with two top-mounted turboshaft engines driving a mid-mounted 17.3 m five-blade main rotor and a three-blade tail rotor. The engine configuration gave the aircraft its distinctive double air intake. Original versions have an angular greenhouse-style cockpit; Model D and later have a characteristic tandem cockpit with a "double bubble" canopy. Other airframe components came from the Mi-14 "Haze". Two mid-mounted stub wings provide weapon hardpoints, each offering three stations, in addition to providing lift. The loadout mix is mission-dependent; Mi-24s can be tasked with close air support, anti-tank operations, or aerial combat.

The Mi-24 fuselage is armored and can resist impacts from 12.7 mm (0.50 in) rounds from all angles. The titanium rotor blades are resistant to 12.7 mm rounds. The cockpit is protected by ballistic-resistant windscreens and a titanium-armored tub. The cockpit and crew compartment are over-pressurized to protect the crew in NBC conditions.

Considerable attention was given to making the Mi-24 fast. The airframe was streamlined, and fitted with retractable tricycle undercarriage landing gear to reduce drag. At high speed, the wings provide considerable lift (up to a quarter of the total lift). The main rotor was tilted 2.5° to the right from the fuselage to compensate for translating tendency at a hover. The landing gear was also tilted to the left so that the rotor would still be level when the aircraft was on the ground, making the rest of the airframe tilt to the left. The tail was also asymmetrical to give a side force at speed, thus unloading the tail rotor.

Comparison to Western helicopters
As a combination of armored gunship and troop transport, the Mi-24 has no direct NATO counterpart. While the UH-1 ("Huey") helicopters were used in the Vietnam War either to ferry troops or as gunships, they were not able to do both at the same time. Converting a UH-1 into a gunship meant stripping the entire passenger area to accommodate extra fuel and ammunition, and removing its troop transport capability. The Mi-24 was designed to do both, and this was greatly exploited by airborne units of the Soviet Army during the 1980–89 Soviet-Afghan War. The closest Western equivalent was the Sikorsky S-67 Blackhawk, which used many of the same design principles and was also built as a high-speed, high-agility attack helicopter with limited troop transport capability using many components from the existing Sikorsky S-61. The S-67, however, was never adopted for service. Other Western equivalents are the Romanian Army's IAR 330, which is a license-built armed version of the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma, and the MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator, a special purpose armed variant of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk. The Hind has been called the world's only "assault helicopter" due to its combination of firepower and troop-carrying capability


A modified Mi-24B, named A-10, was used in several speed and time-to-climb world record attempts. The helicopter had been modified to reduce weight as much as possible—one measure was the removal of the stub wings. The previous official speed record was set on 13 August 1975 over a closed 1000 km course of 332.65 km/h (206.7 mph); many of the female-specific records were set by the all-female crew of Galina Rastorguyeva and Lyudmila Polyanskaya. On 21 September 1978, the A-10 set the absolute speed record for helicopters with 368.4 km/h (228.9 mph) over a 15/25 km course. The record stood until 1986 when it was broken by the current official record holder, a modified British Westland Lynx.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, CFE Treaty, Chad, Congo, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Georgia, Guinea, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), North Macedonia, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Senegal, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Yemen, Zimbabwe.

Here is Variants information for the Mi-24 (Hind) Russian Attack Helicopter:
The V-24 is The first version, twelve prototypes, and development aircraft. The first V-24 mockup resembled the Bell UH-1A Huey. Later models resembled the future Hind-A, one of which was modified in 1975 as A-10 for speed record attempts with wings removed and faired over and with inertia-type dampers on the main rotor head. The A-10 reached a speed of 368 km/h. It was armed with GSh-23 and could carry up to six missiles or rockets..
The Mi-24 is (Hind-A) Other early versions were the armed assault helicopter, which could carry eight combat troops and three crew members. It could also carry four 57mm rocket pods on four underwing pylons, four MCLOS 9M17 Fleyta (AT-2 Swatter) anti-tank missiles on two underwing rails, free-fall bombs, plus one Afanasev A-12.7 12.7mm machine-gun in the nose. The Mi-24 was the first production model..
The Mi-24F is (Hind-A) Modified Hind-A with seven reinforcing ribs on the port fuselage aft of the wing and the SRO-2M Khrom ("Odd Rods") IFF antenna relocated from the canopy to the oil cooler. The APU exhaust was also extended and angled downwards. The designation may be unofficial..
The Mi-24A is (Hind-B) The Mi-24A was the second production model. Both the Mi-24 and Mi-24A entered the Soviet Air Forces service in 1972. They Lacked the four-barrel Yak-B 12.7mm machine gun under the nose..
The Mi-24U is (Hind-C) Training version without nose gun and wingtip stations..
The Mi-24BMT is Small number of Mi-24s converted into minesweepers..
The Mi-24D (Hind-D) is The Mi-24D was a purer gunship than the earlier variants. It entered production in 1973. The Mi-24D has a redesigned forward fuselage, with two separate cockpits for the pilot and gunner. It is armed with a single 12.7mm four-barrel Yak-B machine gun under the nose. It can carry four 57mm rocket pods, four SACLOS 9M17 Phalanga anti-tank missiles (a significant enhancement compared to the MCLOS system found on the Mi-24A), plus bombs and other weapons. One Mi-24D was sold to Poland in January 1996 and was used by the WTD 61 in Manching during 1994 for tests with the head of a MIM-23 Hawk missile in place of the chin-mounted gun. This version also had an unidentified modification in the rear cabin window on the starboard side..

The Mi-24VP is (Hind-E Mod) Development of Mi-24V was made in 1985 which replaced the machine-gun with twin 23mm autocannons in a movable turret. Entered service in 1989, but only 25 were made before production ended the same year. One Mi-24VP flew with the Delta-H tail rotor of the Mil Mi-28..
The Mi-24RKhR is (Hind-G1) NBC reconnaissance model, which is designed to collect radiation, biological and chemical samples. It was first seen during the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Also known as the Mi-24R, Mi-24RK and Mi-24RKh (Rch).

The MI-24RKhR lacks many of the undernose electro-optic and RF missile guidance systems associated with most of the Mi-24 assault helicopters. The stub wings are retained, but in place of the wingtip weapon stations, there are what can be described as 'clutching hand' excavator mechanisms on the end of the pylon which are able to obtain six soil samples per sortie; air samples are sucked in via a pipe on the port side, forward of the doors with it exhausting through a horizontal slit above. The exact detection methods and models of the NBC detection systems are not known.

The helicopter features an NBC protection system for the crew, though it is not clear from the specifications if the personnel is fully suited in NBC protective equipment, or if the aircraft is fully NBC filtered with the personnel wearing normal aircrew suits and are supplied collectively filtered NBC agent-free air. The output exhaust pipe of the NBC system is reported to be under the port side of the cabin.

The aircraft is also fitted with two additional seats for the analysis personnel, a small rearward-firing marker flag/flare pack on its tail-skid, a bubble window on the starboard side of the main cabin, and it has a datalink to pass findings to ground stations..
