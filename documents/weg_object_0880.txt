This document describes the Hero-30 American Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The Hero-30 American Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is the smallest system among the HERO family of smart loitering systems. The Hero-30 is an anti-personnel/anti-material tactical loitering munition system, optimized for the demands of modern asymmetric warfare, and designed for precision strikes on targets beyond line-of-sight. Its multi-mission warheads make it a highly versatile asset for military operations, while its compact and lightweight design allows for quick deployment in any terrain, without the need for previous experience. It is capable of engaging targets with pinpoint accuracy, even in densely populated urban areas, open fields, and mountainous terrain. 

The Hero-30â€™s high precision capabilities, reduces collateral damage to a minimum, hence providing all echelons with a significant advantage in modern asymmetric conflicts and challenging battlefield environments. 

The Hero-30 loiters above a target, and strikes precisely when the opportunity arises, even if the target appears for only an instant. If the mission is canceled, it has the ability to abort the attack, and return to loitering mode until re-engaging the targets when the time is right.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.
