This document describes the NSG-85/CS/LR19 Chinese 7.62mm Sniper Rifle.

The NSG-85/CS/LR19 Chinese 7.62mm Sniper Rifle is manufactured in China and is offered internationally through the state-owned NORINCO corporation. This rifle, which is known by two separate names (NORINCO NSG-85 or NORINCO CS/LR19) is an upgraded version of the Chinese Type 85 sniper rifle, which in turn is a copy of the Russian Dragunov SVD rifle. Retaining the same basic layout and design features of the SVD, NORINCO NSG-85 features several improvements such as heavier, cold-hammer-forged and free-floating barrel, redesigned stocks made from polymer, and a revised receiver which allows the use of the top-mounted Picatinny rail instead of the side-mounted dovetailed rail found on original Dragunov SVD rifles.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, China.
