This document describes the Type 306B (LLQ305B) Chinese Self-Propelled 3D Acquisition Radar.

The Type 305B 3D acquisition radar appears to be a variant of the existing NRIET / CEIEC / CETC YLC-2V, which has been photographed as part of a HQ-9 battery, and has been reported as employed to support up to four HT-233 engagement radars, each with four TELs. Chinese sources describe this radar as optimised for search and acquisition of aerial targets.

The principal distinction between the established YLC-2V and the Type 305B would appear to be the absence of the IFF/SSR array mounted across the top of the antenna.

A Chinese language PRC publication has described the Type 305B  as a “ three dimensional radar which has an antenna height of 3.5 metres, and employs sixty 350 mm  waveguide feeds. It operates in the S-band at a wavelength of 11.67 cm.”3

The YLC-2V employs a single 6 x 6 truck carrying the antenna head and turntable, which is hydraulically deployed, and three additional 6 x 6 trucks carrying cabins for electronics and operator stations. None of the latter were displayed with the Type 305B antenna systems.

The hydraulically folded antenna used with the Type 305B has 58 element rows and will employ  frequency scanning like other radars in this family of designs. Row spacing suggests S-band operation, like the YLC-2V.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
