This document describes the Chamsuri Class South Korean Patrol Boat.

Chamsuri-class patrol vessels are naval boats that function as patrol boats. These entered service with the Republic of Korea Navy in the 1970s, and have since seen service with three other navies, of which the Philippine Navy is currently the largest import user.

These boats were built by the Hanjin Industrial SB, Chinhae, and Korea SB & Eng. Masan shipyards.

These boats, also referred to as patrol killer medium "PKM", were built in two batches: the 201 series, and the more heavily armed 301 series. Early PKM 201 series boats were initially armed with one 40 mm/60 Bofors Mk.3, one twin 30 mm/75 Emerlec EX-30, and two 20 mm/70 Mk.10 AA. Late PKM 201 boats were armed with one twin 30 mm/75 Emerlec EX-30, one or two turreted single 20 mm Vulcan Gatlings, and two single 12.7 mm machine guns. The PKM 301 boats were armed with one 40 mm/60 Bofors in a fully enclosed mount, two turreted single 20 mm Vulcan Gatlings, and two single 12.7 mm machine guns (before the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong two single 7.62 mm M60 machine guns). 

The Chamsuri-class boats are being retired and replaced by Gumdoksuri-class patrol vessel in the Republic of Korea Navy.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, East Timor (Timor-Leste), Ghana, Kazakhstan, Philippines, South Korea (Republic of Korea).
