This document describes the 1V152 FIST Kapustnik-B Russian 8x8 Amphibious Command and Forward Observer Vehicle.

The 1V152 is called a “unified command vehicle;” of somewhat modular interior design, there are two versions of the 1V152, a FIST vehicle and an FDC vehicle.  Both carry the same designation, but have different equipment and different capabilities.

The BTR-80 1V152 version is used by battalion commanders and forward observers in field artillery units. This variant contains special navigation, range finding, and vision equipment


The 1V152 FIST version uses a wider and somewhat taller turret which not only houses the gunner/observer, but a large array of vision equipment, including extensive night vision equipment and day vision equipment along with a laser rangefinder.  The original 1V152 had a relatively simple control computer to tie together the inertial navigation system and the sensors and provide targeting information to artillery, mortar, or MRL batteries.  This computer does not compute fire solutions, though it can calculate corrections to observed fire.  The 1V152 FIST has three long-range radios (two of them data capable), one medium-range radio, and one short-range radio.  The 1V152 has an internal 4kW generator to power electronics and sensors when the vehicle’s engine is off.  The 1V152 has a 10-meter extendable antenna for extended-range communications and more advanced whip antennas.  The 1V152 also carries an assortment of maps and map markers, manual plotting devices, and hand-held calculators as a backup for the computers. The 1V152 carries not only a turret-mounted laser rangefinder, but also a hand-held laser rangefinder for use away from the vehicle; this laser rangefinder can be connected by a cable to the vehicle’s artillery fire control computer to feed information directly to it.  The vehicle also carries a hand-held image intensifier and several pairs of binoculars.

     Later versions increase the capabilities and reliability of the main computer to allow it to tie into the new GLONASS system or the inertial navigation system, and give recommendations on what round might be the most effective.  This computer can produce limited fire solutions, though they will not be as accurate as those produced by a dedicated FDC. The improved version has an advanced active/passive IR viewer with a range of 1500 meters in the passive mode and 3000 meters in the active mode; the 1V152 FIST has a small IR searchlight for use when the IR is in the active mode.  The improved version adds a thermal imager and a laser designator.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
