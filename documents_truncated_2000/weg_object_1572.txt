This document describes the Type 068 Class (Yuchin Class) Chinese Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM).

The Yuch'in class landing craft, mechanized entered the People's Liberation Army Navy service from 1962–1972 and consists of two types, the Type 068 and Type 069, one of steel construction, the other of aluminum. Type 068 / 069 landing craft comes from a long series of landing craft originated in the mid-1950s.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Tanzania.

Here is Variants information for the Type 068 Class (Yuchin Class) Chinese Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM):
The Type 363/363A/55 landing craft: is The origin of Type 068/069 landing craft dates back in 1955, when China decided to produce its own version of landing craft, after the successful production of Soviet T-4 class landing craft. Designed by the Ship Product Design Directorate of the Shipbuilding Industry Managerial Bureau of the First Machinery Industrial Ministry , Type 363 is the first indigenous developed amphibious warfare boats in China, and it is a scaled-down version of former Soviet T-4 landing craft. Work begun in October 1955 at Dalian Shipyard, and on March 30, 1956, the first unit was completed and entered service. Redesign immediately begun after shortcoming was revealed during the trials, and the new designed was named Type 363A (363甲) landing craft. Further refinement of this class eventually resulted in Type 55 landing craft..
The Type 066/066K/066A landing craft is In 1959, to meet urgent need of Fujian Military District to supply coastal islands, PLAN issued requirement to improve Type 55 landing craft. The new design was named Type 066, and construction begun on Aug 1, 1959 at Qiuxin Shipyard vat Shanghai and was completed on December 30, 1959. Redesign begun immediately in February 1960 after shortcoming revealed in trials of the first unit, and the refined design was designated as Type 066K, and went into series production. In August, 1968, a further development of Type 066K designated as Type 066A (066甲) entered production, and the design team member included Mr. Lu Zhengrong (陆正荣), Mr. Zhang Tiemin, Mr. Mei Baoqing, Mr. Jiang Wenbai and Mr. Zheng Zongzhen. A total of 30 Type 066/066K/066A boats were built, including conversions of earlier units to the latest standard, and this class received NATO reporting name Yuzhai class. Some have been converted as buoy tenders..
The Type 068/069 landing craft is Type 068/069 landing craft is the natural development of earlier Type 066 landing craft. PLAN needs a scaled-down version of Type 067 landing craft utility, and Type 066 is developed into Type 068/069 to be used in conjunction with Type 067 landing craft. In addition to domestic Chinese use, exports include six to Bangladesh, and two to Tanzania. Due to its small size, this class can be and often are maintained and stored on land and thus remain in good condition despite their age, though some have been converted for survey missions..
