This document describes the GQL-111 Chinese 8x8 Scissor-Type Bridging System.

GQL-111 Chinese 8x8 Scissor-Type Bridging System is known to deploy a significant number of truck-mounted bridge systems. This is conceptually similar to the Russian TMM-6 heavy bridge building system. One section can be used to span a gap of up to 15 m, and a complete set of five can span a gap of 75 m. The GQL111 can be used to span wet and dry gaps, with each scissors bridge having an adjustable leg that can be extended to 5.5 m below. It can also be used with pontoons to enable wider rivers to be crossed.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Myanmar, Peru.
