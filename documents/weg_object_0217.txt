This document describes the HY-4 (CSS-C-7) Sadsack Chinese Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile.

The HY-4 development of the C-201 is a mid-range ground-, air-, and ship-launched cruise missile. Development of the C-201 HY-4 is believed to have started in the mid-1970s, replacing the C-201 HY-2 liquid propellant sustainer motor with a small turbojet engine, and adding a monopulse active radar seeker. Apart from the substitution of the turbojet engine, the overall configuration of the HY-4 variant of the C-201 missile is similar to the HY-2 variants of the C-201, with two delta wings and tri-form rudder and tail. The missile has a radar altimeter which allows the cruise height to be varied between 70 and 200 m altitude, followed by a steep dive onto the target. The air-launched version is designated as C-401

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh.

Here is Variants information for the HY-4 (CSS-C-7) Sadsack Chinese Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile:
The HY-1 is Basic developmental version developed from the SY missiles, used only in very small numbers as land-to-ship missile for evaluation purposes. Did not enter series production and was replaced by HY-1J..
The HY-1J is Ship-to-ship variant for Type 051 DDG.
The HY-1JA is Improved ship-to-ship variant with a new radar seeker for better anti-jamming capability and accuracy.
The HY-1A is Land-to-ship variant based on the HY-1JA.
The HY-1B is Low level target drone for the test of HQ-2A SAM.
