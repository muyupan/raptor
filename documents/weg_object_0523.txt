This document describes the Boxer RCH 155 German 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

In April 2014, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann decided to integrate the artillery gun module (AGM) onto the Boxer armored vehicle, with the system making an appearance at Eurosatory in June 2014. The Boxer has to prove it can deal with recoil forces without stabilization, but stabilization concepts can be added if needed to retain shoot and scoot and 360-degree firing capability. The Boxer-AGM system could be used as an upgrade option for countries with existing boxer fleets. Test firings were completed in 2014.

Firing trials with the turret traversed front and to its sides were carried out at WTD 41 proving ground and were successful without the use of stabilizers. The trials also demonstrated the ability to fire an 8-round burst and redeploy under 90 seconds and carry out multi-round simultaneous impact missions. The combination of the Boxer vehicle with AGM became known as Remote Controlled Howitzer 155 (RCH 155) due to the turret module being remote controlled. Additionally, a remote weapons station with a .50 caliber machine gun has been fitted on the roof.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Germany.
