This document describes the DJI Matrice 300 RTK Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The DJI Matrice 300 RTK Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has created a new standard for the commercial drone industry. With inspiration from modern aviation systems, the DJI Matrice 300 RTK offers up to 55 minutes of high-performance flight time with TB60 Batteries combined with unrivaled reliability. The advanced flight control system, 6 Directional Sensing and Positioning system, AI spot-checking, Smart Track, PinPoint, Location Sharing, and an all-new Primary Flight Display make the Matrice 300 RTK one of the most powerful and capable industrial platforms on the market.

The airframe design of the Matrice 300 RTK gives the system an Ingress Protection (IP) rating of IP45, while its mechanical design with quick-release landing gear and folding arms make the platform incredibly easy to transport, store and prepare for flight. Batteries for the Matrice 300 RTK are charged and can be stored and transported in the DJI BS60 Battery Station which is capable of carrying up to eight TB60 batteries and two WB37 remote controller batteries.

The DJI M300 RTK is compatible with many of DJI's camera and sensor payloads, along with official DJI PSDK payloads currently available. The platform's multi-gimbal system allows for gimbal configurations that consist of the following: single downward, single upward, dual downward, single upward + single downward, or single upward + dual downward. The variety of gimbal configurations gives the Matrice 300 RTK ultimate flexibility and put it in a class of its own with its triple payload ability with a maximum payload capacity of 6 lbs.

Anti-collision beacons and strobes on both the top and bottom of the airframe meet the FAA's 3 statute mile visibility requirement for night operations with an FAA 107.29 daylight operations waiver. These beacons allow the aircraft to be seen and identified at night or in low-light flying conditions while enhancing operational safety.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
