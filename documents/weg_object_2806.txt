This document describes the Type 84 Chinese Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) System.

Type 84 Chinese Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) System is essentially a Type 69 MBT with its turret removed, fitted with a bridge-launching mechanism similar to that on the German Leopard 1 Biber system. When opened out, the bridge, which is launched over the front of the vehicle, is 18 m long, can span gaps of up to 16m, and take tracked and wheeled vehicles weighing up to 40 tons.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Tanzania, Zimbabwe.

Here is Variants information for the Type 84 Chinese Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) System:
The Type 84 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) is The Type 84 AVLB launches a bridge with a weight capacity of 40,000 kg, but more recent Chinese MBTs, for example the Type 98 and Type 99, weigh far more than the bridgeʼs current weight capacity..
The 60T HMB is The 60T HMB from NORINCO is a truck mounted bridge designed to conduct deliberate crossings of dry and wet gaps. One set consists of a total of five vehicles, each of which can transport and launch one bridge. This set has a total crew of 12, of which seven are required to position each span..
The Type 84A Chinese Heavy Mechanized Bridging (HMB) System is The Type 84A Chinese Heavy Mechanized Bridging (HMB) System can hold tracked armored vehicles weighing up to 50 metric tons on five modular spans. It can handle wheeled vehicles with a maximum axle load of 13 metric tons. The bridge can span a gap of up to 50m. When the bridge is being deployed, the truck backs up to the gap, drops hydraulic stabilizers on either side of the rear, and opens the bridge over the obstacle to be crossed. Outriggers are then opened and extended below the bridge. The bridge sections are carried and placed into position by an 8 x 8 or 6 x 6 wheeled vehicle. Each span is 10.5m long. Up to five can be coupled together. The system can be used in water as deep as 3.5 m. The bridge can also be connected with various types of pontoon bridges..
