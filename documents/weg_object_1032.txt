This document describes the EC-130H (Compass Call) American Airborne Electronic Warfare System.

The EC-130H Compass Call is an airborne tactical EW weapon system with a primary mission to disrupt enemy command and control. The aircraft is a heavily modified variant of the C-130 Hercules featuring a large antenna array attached to the tail-section of the aircraft and onboard advanced computer systems that enable direction-finding, listening and jamming of enemy communications.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the EC-130H (Compass Call) American Airborne Electronic Warfare System:
The EC-130E ABNCC is This was an EC-130E with an airborne command and control center (ABNCC) in a roll-on/roll-off tactical command post capsule..
The EC-130G/Q is A U.S. Navy C-130E fitted with AN/USC-13 TACAMO (take charge and move out) communications equipment by Rockwell was used in support of strategic missile submarines. This included the AN/USC-13 airborne VLF communications suite with a trailing wire antenna over 30,000 feet in length. This equipment was later "stripped-out" for use in E-6 Hermes successors. The last EC-130Q was delivered to Rockwell International for strip-out in May 1992. Altogether, Rockwell converted 22 EC-130G and EC-130Q aircraft..
The EC-130J Commando Solo is Highly specialized modifications have been made to the aircraft. Included in these modifications are enhanced navigation systems, self-protection equipment and the capability of broadcasting color television on a multitude of worldwide standards throughout the TV VHF/UHF ranges.

The EC-130J has two 23 ft x 6 ft (7 m x 1.8 m) underwing pods that carry VHF and UHF broadcast antennas for high-frequency TV channel broadcasts. Four pods mounted on the both sides of the tail house VHF antennas that are dedicated to the lower-frequency TV frequencies.

The aircraft is capable of broadcasting on eight frequencies simultaneously.

Defensive equipment includes ALR-56M radar warning receiver; AAR-54 PMAWS; ALE-47 TACDS; and AAQ-24 DIRCM.
The EC-130J crew includes a pilot, co-pilot, flight systems officers, mission systems officer, two loadmasters and five electronic communication systems operators..
