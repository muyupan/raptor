This document describes the Carl Gustaf M2 Swedish 84mm Man-Portable Anti-Tank Recoilless Rifle.

Swedish arms designers began to experiment with recoilless antitank rifles in early 1940s. Their first design, a shoulder-fired, single shot weapon, fired a20mm solid projectile from a rifled barrel. This design has been adopted by Swedish army in 1942 as the m/42, but its small-caliber solid projectile was hardly effective against the new tanks, which emerged during the Second Worldwar. By the mid-1940s, Swedish designers adopted the idea of the shaped-charge HEAT ammunition, and by the 1946 produced their first prototype of the large-caliber recoilless rifle, which fired HEAT grenades. This single-shot,shoulder fired weapon quickly evolved into the "Granatgevär 8.4cm m/48Carl-Gustaf", or "Grenade rifle, caliber 84mm, model of 1948".This simple and effective weapon attracted significant interest and has been adopted by a significant number of military forces around the world. Other than Sweden, Carl Gustaf recoilless rifles were adopted by Australia, Austria, Belgium,Canada, Germany, USA and several other countries. Initial production was by the FFV factories, latter transferred to the SAAB-Bofors Dynamics AB, which is the current manufacturer of both M3 rifle and 84mm ammunition. The ammunition alsois manufactured in several countries which use the Carl-Gustaf launchers,including the Belgium and India.
 While the Carl-Gustaf recoilless rifle / launcher was initially devised as an antitank weapon, its tactical role was quickly expanded with adoption of various other types of ammunition, such as high-explosive fragmentation rounds, close-defense shrapnel-type rounds, smoke, illumination and several other types of warheads.In fact, the Carl-Gustaf series recoilless rifles / launchers are among the most versatile weapons of the "one man artillery" type, extremely popular and widely used. Their only drawback is the bulk and weight of the launcher itself, which is significantly heavier than its major rival, the venerable RPG-7 antitank grenade launcher.

The Carl-Gustaf series recoilless rifles /launchers are single shot, breech loading weapons with rifled barrels. Unitary ammunition of 84mm caliber is loaded into aluminum cases with open bottoms,closed by plastic pressure discs. The primers are located at the side of the cartridge case, so the round must be properly aligned in the bore upon the loading. To achieve that, the case rim has a special indexing recess. Most types of projectiles are just warheads which are "blown out" of the barrel by the propellant charge, but some most recently developed types of ammunition has built-in rocket boosters, which are ignited as the round reaches safe distance from the shooter, greatly improving the maximum effective range. The rear part of the barrel is fitted with venturi nozzle, which is hinged to allow loading of the ammunition and ejection of the fired cases or unfired rounds. The M2 (m/48) barrels are made from steel, and the M3 (m/86) barrels are made from thin steel liners enclosed into polymer wrapping, so the M3 launcher is significantly lighter. The firing unit consists of the pistol grip with the trigger and manual safety, which is linked to the ignition module at the rear of the weapon by the tube, located below and to the right of the barrel. Under the barrel, there's also a shoulder rest, an adjustable bipod, and a front support grip. The Carl-Gustaf recoilless rifles / launchers are fitted with folding open sights, located at the left side of the barrel, but usually issued with telescope sight of 2X or 3X magnification, which has range-finding reticule and can be adjusted for temperature and wing conditions.
  Standard crew for Carl-Gustaf recoilless rifle / launcher is two men, shooter and loader. Ammunition is usually carried in special plastic containers, which hold two types of ammunition each. Most modern HEAT rounds for Carl-Gustaffeature either single or a tandem shaped-charge warhead, and a rocket booster for increased range, and can penetrate up to 500 mm of armor behind the ERAprotection. 

The Gustaf was soon sold around the world and became one of the primary squad-level anti-tank weapons for many West European armies. An improved, lighter and slightly shorter version, the Carl Gustaf M2, was introduced in 1964 and quickly replaced the original version. The current Carl Gustaf M3 version was introduced in 1991. It reduced the weight even further by replacing the forged steel tube with a thin steel liner containing the rifling, strengthened by a carbon fiber outer sleeve. The external steel parts were also replaced with plastics and aluminium alloys.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Australia, Denmark, Estonia, India, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Myanmar, Netherlands, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Here is Variants information for the Carl Gustaf M2 Swedish 84mm Man-Portable Anti-Tank Recoilless Rifle:
The M1 (1948) is Original, still in Service with Third-World Countries.
The M2 (1963) is An improved, lighter and slightly shorter version, the Carl Gustaf M2, was introduced in 1964 and quickly replaced the original version..
The M3 (1991) is The current Carl Gustaf M3 version was introduced in 1991. It reduced the weight even further by replacing the forged steel tube with a thin steel liner containing the rifling, strengthened by a carbon fiber outer sleeve. The external steel parts were also replaced with plastics and aluminium alloys. In recent years, the M3 has found new life in a variety of roles. The British Special Air Service, United States Army Special Forces and United States Army Rangers use M3s in bunker-busting and anti-vehicle roles, while the German Bundeswehr maintains a small number of M2s for battlefield illumination. Many armies continue to use it as a viable anti-armor weapon, especially against 1950s- and 1960s-era tanks and other armored vehicles still in use worldwide..
The M3 MAAWS is In November 2011, the U.S. Army began ordering the M3 MAAWS for regular units deployed in Afghanistan. Soldiers were being engaged with RPGs at 900 meters, while their light weapons had effective ranges of 500–600 meters. The Gustaf allows airburst capability of troops in defilade out to 1,250 meters, and high explosive use out to 1,300 meters. While the weapon provides enhanced effectiveness, its 9.5 kg (21 lb) weight burdens troops. On 28 March 2013, USSOCOM announced a call for sources to develop a kit to lighten the M3 MAAWS and reduce overall length without affecting handling or ruggedness. By that time, Saab was developing a weight-reduced version prior to the SOCOM release that demonstrated no decrease in performance, no increase in recoil, and nearly equivalent barrel life that could be ready for government testing in 2014. Saab has also developed a new high explosive round that has a direct fire range of 1,500 meters when using a fire control system.

The US Defense Department agreed to evaluate the shorter and lighter M4 version over the next two years; testing and qualifications were planned to be completed in spring 2017, and the weapon type classified as the M3E1 in fall 2017, making the system available for procurement to all Department of Defense services. The first unit is planned to be equipped with the M3E1 in 2018.

In April 2019, a contract of SEK168 million (USD18.1 million) was approved to supply the Australian Army with ammunition for the Carl-Gustaf M4 84 mm multipurpose weapon systems ordered by the service in September 2018..
The M4 (M3-E1) is At AUSA 2014, Saab Dynamics displayed its new Carl Gustaf M4 variant. Compared to the M3 MAAWS, the M4 is 3.4 kg (7.5 lb) lighter, weighing 6.6 kg (15 lb), and shorter with a 950 mm (37 in) overall length. The shorter length was in response to the need to wield the weapon in urban terrain, and weight savings were achieved through using lighter components whenever possible including a carbon fiber tube with titanium liner, as well as a new venturi design. Other new features include a red-dot sight, a travel safety catch to allow the M4 to be carried while loaded, an adjustable shoulder rest and forward grip for improved ergonomics, a shot counter to keep track of how many rounds have been fired to manage the weapon's 1,000-round barrel life, picatinny rails for grips and sight mounts, and a remote round management function so intelligent sights can "talk" to programmable rounds..
