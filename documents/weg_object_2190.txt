This document describes the TM-46 Russian Anti-Tank Mine.

The TM-46 mine is a large, circular, metal-cased Soviet anti-tank mine. It uses either a pressure fuze or tilt-rod, which is screwed into the top. Anti-tank mines with this type of fuze were capable of inflicting much more damage to armored vehicles. The TMN-46 is a variant of the mine fitted with a secondary fuze well on the bottom (where it cannot be seen) which is slightly offset from the center of the mine. This secondary fuze well can be fitted with a pull-fuze which functions as an anti-handling device. The mine was used by the North Vietnamese forces during the Vietnam War, and is found in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia.

Because the TM-46 has a metal casing, it is very easy to detect with a mine detector. However, mine fields containing TM-46s may have also been sown with minimum metal mines, e.g. the PMA-2.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation, Viet Nam.
