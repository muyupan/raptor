This document describes the M60 American 7.62mm General-Purpose Machine Gun.

The initial variant was officially adopted by the U.S. Army in the late 1950s, though at this time it was only intended for the infantry. It was known as the T161 before it was adopted (specifically the T161E3), and was chosen over the competing T52 during testing in the 1950s. They both used a similar feed and were both gas-operated, but the T161 was easier to produce and its different internals performed better. The model that won the competition was the T161E3.

The model was type-classified in 1957 and entered production. It saw its first heavy use in the 1960s. The basic design has undergone some smaller changes and has been produced by different manufacturers.

The M60 is a belt-fed machine gun that fires the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge (similar to .308 Winchester), which is commonly used in larger rifles. It is generally used as a crew-served weapon and operated by a team of two or three individuals. The team consists of the gunner, the assistant gunner (AG), and the ammunition bearer. The gun's weight and the amount of ammunition it can consume when fired make it difficult for a single soldier to carry and operate. The gunner carries the weapon and, depending on his strength and stamina, anywhere from 200 to 1,000 rounds of ammunition. The assistant carries a spare barrel and extra ammunition, and reloads and spots targets for the gunner. The ammunition bearer carries additional ammunition and the tripod with associated traversing and elevation mechanism, if issued, and fetches more ammunition as needed during firing.

The M60 can be accurately fired at short ranges from the shoulder thanks to its design. This was an initial requirement for the design and a hold-over in concept from the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. It may also be fired from the integral bipod, M122 tripod, and some other mounts.

M60 ammunition comes in a cloth bandolier containing a cardboard box of 100 pre-linked rounds. The M60 uses the M13 ammunition link, a change from the older M1 link system with which it was not compatible. The cloth bandolier is reinforced to allow it to be hung from the current version of the feed tray. Historically, units in Vietnam used B3A cans from C-rations packs locked into the ammunition box attachment system to roll the ammunition belts over for a straighter and smoother feed to the loading port to enhance the reliability of feed. The later models changed the ammunition box attachment point and made this adaptation unnecessary.

The M60 has been adopted by various military agencies around the world, it also has been updated and modernized throughout the years to meet modern military requirements.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Australia, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Ghana, Greece, Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Senegal, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Spain, Sudan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam.

Here is Variants information for the M60 American 7.62mm General-Purpose Machine Gun:
The M60 is The basic model, type-classified in 1957..

The M60E2 is Used in vehicles as a coaxial machine gun; electrically fired..
The M60B is Used in helicopters in the 1960s and 1970s; unmounted..
The M60C is Used in fixed mounts in aircraft in the 1960s and 1970s; electrically fired and hydraulically charged..
The M60D is Replaced the M60B; a pintle-mounted variant used especially in armament subsystem for helicopters, but also some other roles..
The M60E3 is An updated, lightweight variant adopted in the 1980s..
The M60E4 (Mk 43 Mod 0/1) is An improved variant of the 1990s that looks similar to the M60E3, but has many improvements. It has sub variants of its own, and is also used by the U.S. Navy (as the Mk 43 Mod 0/1). The Mk 43 Mod 1 is a specialized variant with additions such as extra rails for mounting accessories..
The M60E6 is A lightened and improved variant of the M60E4..

The Note is The M60D is a mounted variant of the standard M60. It can be mounted on boats, vehicles and as a pintle-mounted door gun in helicopters. When used in aircraft, it differs from the M60C in that it is not controlled by the pilot—rather, it is mounted in a door and operated by a member of the crew. Like the rest of the M60 family, it is an air-cooled, gas-operated, belt-fed weapon. Unlike other models, however, the M60D normally has spade grips and an aircraft ring-type sight or similar, as well as an improved ammunition feed system. A canvas bag is also affixed to the gun to capture ejected casings and links, preventing them from being sucked into the rotor blades or into an engine intake. The M60D was equipped on the UH-1B Huey (using the M23, XM29, M59, and the Sagami mounts), the CH-47 Chinook (using the M24 and M41 mounts) in both door and ramp locations, the ACH-47A "Guns-A-Go-Go" variant of the Chinook (using the XM32 and XM33 mounts), and on the UH-60 Black Hawk (using the M144 mount). The M60D is also used by the British on Royal Air Force Chinooks. In US service, the M60D has been primarily replaced by the M240H. The M60D is still manufactured by U.S. Ordnance and still used on the SH-60 Seahawk..
