This document describes the T-80BK (Ob'yekt 660) Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The  T-80BK (Ob'yekt 660) Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT) is a further development of the original T-80, which was produced only in small numbers. The T-80B is the first variant produced in quantity. The T-80BK is the command variant of the T-80B. It is an MBT equipped with additional communications equipment allowing local control of armored units and coordination with the upper levels of C2.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the T-80BK (Ob'yekt 660) Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The T-80 (1976) is Initial model, with a 1,000-hp gas turbine engine, coincidence rangefinder, and no missile capability. This model does not have fittings for explosive reactive armor. The turret is from the T-64A, and thus retains the use of the old coincidence rangefinder. Characteristics of this type are the V-shaped water deflector on the front glacis, coincidence rangefinder in front of the commander's cupola, and Luna searchlight mounted in the same position as a T-64. Around 250 were produced, as the tank's armor was essentially obsolete when introduced. Turret vs APFSDS – 380 mm, hull vs APFSDS – 500 mm (without reactive armor). This was, in effect, a pre-production model. It reportedly was fitted with an early version of the Shtora APS..
The T-80BV (1985) is T-80B with explosive reactive armour Kontakt-1..
The T-80UM: is Russian version, with new Buran thermal imaging sight in place of the Luna IR..
The Object 219A: Early T-80U (Object 219AS) variant is It has the T-80U's turret, but not the Kontakt-5 ERA. Instead, it uses the old Kontakt-1/3 system; some 219As did not have ERA at all. Often misnamed T-80A.
T-80U (1985): Further development with a better turret, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, improved gunsight, and 9M119 Svir missile system. In 1990 a new, 1,250-hp, engine was installed. Overall protection with Kontakt-5 against APFSDS/HEAT is 780/1,320 mm RHAe.9K119M with antitank guided missile 9M119M installed since 1990. Some of the tanks in the commander version (T-80UK) are equipped with Shtora-1 APS, and thermal imaging night sight TO1-PO2T (detection range/target classification range = 6,400/4,600 meters at night). The basic thermal night sight of the T-80U is within the limits of 1,750/1,500 meters..
The T-80UD Bereza (1987) is Ukrainian diesel version with 1,000-hp 6TD engine and remote-controlled antiaircraft machine gun..
The T-84 (1999) is Further Ukrainian development of T-80UD with 1,200-hp diesel and new welded turret..
The T-80BVD (2002): is KMDB's upgrade standard for Ukrainian T-80BVs. Changes include the 6TD diesel engine, remote-controlled commander's machine gun, and better optics. None were produced..
The T-80UM2/Black Eagle (prototype: cancelled): is Several Russian prototypes were shown at trade shows, with a longer chassis and extra pair of road wheels, and very a large turret with a separate ammunition compartment..
The T-80BVM (2017) is up to 3,000 units, installed "Relikt" ERA, PNM Sosna-U gunner sight (as in the T-90, T-72B3), the improved 125mm gun 2A46M-4, the upgraded gas turbine engine, and the upgrades of various other systems. More than 120 are already in the service..
