This document describes the BM-14 Russian 140mm Multiple Launch Rocket System.

The BM-14 (BM for Boyevaya Mashina, 'combat vehicle), is a Soviet-made 140mm multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), normally mounted on a truck.

The BM-14 can fire 140 mm M-14 rockets with a high-explosive fragmentation warhead, a smoke warhead, or a chemical warhead. It is similar to the BM-13 "Katyusha" and was partly replaced in service by the 122 mm BM-21 Grad.

Launchers were built in 16 and 17-round variants. The rockets have a maximum range of 9.8 kilometers (6.1 mi).

The weapon is not accurate as there is no guidance system, but it is extremely effective in saturation fire.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, China, Congo, Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Madagascar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Poland, Russian Federation, Sudan, Syria, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zimbabwe.

Here is Variants information for the BM-14 Russian 140mm Multiple Launch Rocket System:
The BM-14M is improved version, mounted on a ZIL-157 chassis. In 1958 production of the ZIL-151 truck ceased in favor to the newer ZIL-157. So launcher module was simply relocated onto a new chassis..
The BM-14MM is improved version, mounted on a ZIL-131 chassis. It appeared in the mid 1960s. This vehicle has better cross-country mobility due to a 150 hp engine and central tyre inflation system. Artillery module is exactly the same as used on the BM-14. This version was exported to  Burkina Faso..
The BM-14-17 (8U35) is 17-round (8+9 launch tubes) launcher, mounted on the GAZ-63A. Developed in 1959. This launcher was also used on naval vessels, for example Project 1204 patrol boats..
The BM-14-17M (8U35M) is modified model, mounted on the GAZ-66..
