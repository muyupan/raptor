This document describes the 1RL257E Krasukha-4 Russian 8x8 Mobile Multifunctional Jammer.

The Krasuha-4 is a broadband multifunctional jamming system designed to neutralize LEO spy satellites such as the US Lacrosse/Onyx series, satellites, ground-based radars, airborne surveillance radars, and radar-guided ordinance at ranges between 150â€“300 km, and may also cause damage to enemy radar electronic warfare and communications systems. The complex functioning is based on creating powerful jamming at the fundamental radar frequencies and other radio-emitting sources. For jamming of airborne radars to protect the land assets against airborne threats by observing them using radar the ground jamming unit performs the following tasks: Detection, processing, analysis and recognition of signals embedded in the operating range of frequencies; and, suppression of the main and side-lobe antenna signals of ground based radars for protection against airborne threats such as anti-radiation missiles (ARMs). The Krasuha-4 EW equipment is mounted on two KAMAZ-6350 vehicles. The complex 1RL257 includes two trailers with special equipment. Both trailers are equipped with complex electronic equipment and antennas of various designs. One trailer has an antenna unit on a sliding bar, apparently intended for communication. On the roof of the second trailer a set of antennas is mounted in a distinctive configuration. The three parabolic antennas can be rotated in any direction and at a desired elevation. Thus, the complex EW "Krasuha-4" is able to transmit radio signals without restrictions in azimuth and elevation. Both machines use complex digital equipment with high performance characteristics, which includes the Baguette-23B computer.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the 1RL257E Krasukha-4 Russian 8x8 Mobile Multifunctional Jammer:
The Krasukha-2 is The Krasukha-2 is intended to jam AWACS at ranges of up to 250 kilometers (160 mi). The Krasukha-2 is also able to jam other airborne radars, such as radar-guided missiles. The missiles, once jammed, are then provided a false target away from the original to ensure that the missiles are no longer a threat. The Krasukha-2 guard's mobile high priority targets such as the 9K720 Iskander SRBM..
