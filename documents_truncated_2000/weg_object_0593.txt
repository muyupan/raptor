This document describes the M115 American 203mm Towed Howitzer.

The M115 8-in (203-mm) towed howitzer is the largest towed artillery weapon ever developed in the United States. It is no longer in service with the U.S. Army, but it remains in the arsenals of several other countries.


The M115 8 in (203 mm) howitzer, which was replaced by the M110 self-propelled howitzer, is a towed weapon developed prior to World War II as a heavy artillery weapon. The weapon uses NATO standard 203mm ammunition and was used during World War II, in Korea, and in Viet Nam. In NATO service their prime mission was to fire nuclear rounds which have since been phased out of service. Tests of the prototype T3 howitzer began at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1939 and the howitzer entered service as the 8 in Howitzer M1. After the Second World War the complete weapon was redesignated the Howitzer, Heavy, Towed: 8 in: M115. Variants of the M110 with a longer barrel include the M110A1 (no muzzle brake) and the M110A2 (fitted with muzzle brake). In most countries, the M115 and the M110 have been phased out of service due to short-range. The carriage of the 8 in howitzer is also used to mount the 155 mm Gun M1 (Long Tom), which is still in use with some armies.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belgium, China, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Italy, Japan, Jordan, Netherlands, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Spain, Sudan, Taiwan, Turkey, United States of America.
