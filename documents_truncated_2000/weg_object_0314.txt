This document describes the Shahab-3B Iranian Medium-Range Ballistic Missile.

The Shahab-3B Iranian Medium-Range Ballistic Missile differs from the basic production variant. It has improvements to its guidance system and warhead with a greater range, a few small changes on the missile body, and a new re-entry vehicle whose terminal guidance system and rocket-nozzle steering method are completely different from the Shahab-3's spin-stabilized re-entry vehicle.
The new re-entry vehicle uses a triconic aeroshell geometry (or "baby bottle" design) which improves the overall lift-to-drag ratio for the re-entry vehicle. This allows greater range maneuverability which can result in better precision. The iconic design also reduces the overall size of the warhead from an estimated 1 metric ton to 700 kg.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of).
