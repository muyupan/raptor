This document describes the Kvant 1L222 Avtobaza Russian 6x6 Electronic Support (ES) Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) System.

The Kvant 1L222 Avtobaza is an ELINT system designed to detect Side looking airborne radars, air-to-ground fire-control radars and low-altitude flight control radars, as well as to provide intelligence data for the 1L125M APUR. The ELINT system displays on the TV screen acquired targets with data on their direction finding, angular coordinates (azimuth and elevation), radiation signal parameters (carrier frequency, duration, pulse repetition frequency) and radar type classification (sidelooking, fire control, low-altitude flight control radar). The APUR automated jamming control system is fed with target data (frequency band number according to frequency assignment of jamming systems, type of emitting radars and their angular coordinates) via cable at a range of up to 100 meters.


There are unconfirmed reports of the system being used in the capture of an RQ-170 UAV by the Iranian forces on 4 December 2011. There are also unconfirmed reports of it being used by the Russian forces during the Crimean Crisis in March 2014 to overtake controls of an American drone.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
