This document describes the ZBD-05 (VN-18) Chinese Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The ZBD-05 (VN-18) is a Type 05 amphibious infantry fighting vehicle developed by Norinco for the People's Liberation Army. The Type 05 family is a collection of amphibious AFVs in service with China. The vehicles are designed to provide mobility comparable to an MBT on land as well as an amphibious function that performs much better than the average amphibious vehicle. The platforms are used by elements of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as well as the PLA Navy (PLAN) to defend China’s coast and provide a capable military force that can rapidly respond to defense situations on the many islands that are close to China’s coast. The family includes ZBD-05 amphibious infantry fighting vehicle and ZTD-05 amphibious tank (assault gun) as well as several other variants including command vehicle and recovery vehicle. The vehicle could be launched at sea, from an amphibious assault ship over the horizon. It features a hydroplane, and a design concept that has been compared to the US canceled Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the ZBD-05 (VN-18) Chinese Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV):
The ZTD-05 is The ZTD-05 is a fire support vehicle based on the Type 05 hull. It is designed to have the same mobility and protection as the ZBD-05 however it is armed with a large-calibre direct-fire gun. It is designed to provide overwhelming fire support for ZBD-05 formations against embedded infantry and heavily armoured vehicles..
The PLZ-07B is The PLZ-07B is an SPH designed for the Chinese Marine Corps. It is based on the Type 05 hull and uses the weapon system from the PLZ-07, which is based on a different hull. The vehicle is designed to have the same mobility and protection as the ZBD-05, however, it is equipped with a large-calibre howitzer and attendant FCS so that it can provide organic indirect fire support for ZBD-05 formations..
The Type 001 is The Type 001 is an APC based on the Type 05 hull. It is believed that the Type 001 is more likely to be found in service with the amphibious elements of the PLA rather than the Marine Corps, as it has been shown on exercises with the 74th Army Group. It is designed to perform as an APC and is capable of carrying a section of equipped infantry into combat alongside other Type 005 variants..
