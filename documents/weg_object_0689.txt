This document describes the R550 Magic 2 French Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile.

The R550 Magic 2 replaced the AD3601 seeking head by the AD3633, allowing frontal fire on the target. The R550 Magic 1 could only be fired from the rear on the target due to the lack of sensitivity of the IR detector. R550 Magic 2 also received improved counter-countermeasures including flare rejection. R550 Magic 2 has many more improvements over R550 Magic 1, but principally has an all-aspect engagement capability and it takes far less time to prepare the missiles for launch. The R550 Magic 2 retains the same general aerodynamic and external characteristics as the Magic 1, with double cruciform canards (the aft set acting as control surfaces) and free rotating rear fins. Magic 2 is 2.75 m long, has a body diameter of 157 mm, a wing span of 0.66 m and a weight of 90 kg. However, it has an increased range of up to 5 km compare to the R550 Magic 1 with 3 km.

In Pakistan Air Force R550 Magic and R550 Magic 2 short-range missiles can be carried by Mirage III/V, F-16A/B, F-7, and A-5.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: France, Greece, India, Jordan, Qatar, Romania.

The R.550 Magic is The R550 Magic is a short-range missile designed in 1968 by French company Matra to compete with the American AIM-9 Sidewinder.The largest single competitor for Sidewinder in Western Europe, the Matra Magic R.550 has better design and performance requirements. It can be fired at any speed (no minimum), meaning that it is a prime candidate for the arming of attack helicopters. Magic is slightly larger in diameter than Sidewinder, but the launch installation components in the carrying aircraft were wisely made interchangeable. The tail fins of the R.550 are free to rotate around the rocketâ€™s nozzle, providing of spin-stabilization. The Magic has 8 fixed fins, and 4 movable fins. It has a solid-fuel engine, and can engage the target independently from the firing aircraft with its passive IR guidance system. The warhead is armed 1.8 seconds after launch, giving a minimum engagement distance of 0.30 km, and a maximum range of around 3 km..
