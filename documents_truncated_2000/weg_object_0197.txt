This document describes the YJ-83 (CSS-N-8 Saccade) Chinese Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile.

The YJ-83 (NATO reporting name: CSS-N-8 Saccade) is a Chinese subsonic short-range anti-ship cruise missile. It is manufactured by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation Third Academy.

The YJ-83 uses microprocessors and a strap-down inertial reference unit (IRU); these are more compact than the equivalent electronics used in the YJ-8 and the export C-802, allowing the YJ-83 to have a 180-km range at Mach 0.9. The missile is powered by the Chinese CTJ-2 turbojet and carries 190-kg high-explosive fragmentation warhead. Terminal guidance is by an active radar. The YJ-83K, the air-launched variant, has a range of 200 km. This data may be for an improved YJ-83A; the original YJ-83 may have a shorter range, at 120 km and 130 km for the surface- and air-launched versions, respectively.

The YJ-83KH has an electro-optical seeker and may receive course corrections by remote link.

The YJ-83 entered service with the People's Liberation Army Navy in 1998-1999 and has equipped a large number of its surface warships. The YJ-83K equips the Xian JH-7 and H-6G.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Bangladesh, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Myanmar, Pakistan, Yemen.
