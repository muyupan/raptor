This document describes the Type 79 (Type 69-III) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The Type 79 is a Chinese main battle tank (MBT) having the same hull and turret as the earlier Type 59 /69 MBT but a different chassis. It is also designated the Type 69 -III.

Development of the Type 69-II, the Type 79 is said to have improved firepower, fire control, night-vision, and communications equipment.

A large rectangular window has been added to the turret, installed forward of the commander's cupola and possibly housing an internal laser rangefinder.

Four electrical smoke dischargers are mounted to each side of the turret with a metal storage box behind them (probably carrying additional grenades). Additional smoke can be generated by injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust outlet on the left side of the hull.

A stowage rack runs around the back of the turret, which reportedly provides some protection against high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds, detonating them before they come in contact with the armor.

The main armament is a Type 83-I rifled 105-mm gun, derived from the British L7 design, fitted with a fume extractor and thermal sleeve. It is capable of firing armor-piercing, fin-stabilized, discarding-sabot (APFSDS), HEAT and HEAT fragmentation (HEAT-FRAG) rounds. A 12.7-mm anti-aircraft machine gun is mounted on the loader's cupola. The turret also carries a 7.62-mm coaxial machine gun.

While similar to the hull of the Type 69, the rear hull of the Type 79 exhibits slight differences due to a different power pack. In addition, the towing eyes are under the nose and the headlamps are similar to those found on Type 80.

The Type 79 has six road wheels and the upper portion of the suspension is covered by five removable skirts. The tracks on the Type 79 typically come with removable rubber pads.

Standard equipment includes a simple fire-control system; night-vision equipment for the commander, gunner, and driver; an NBC overpressure system; long-range fuel tanks carried on the rear of the hull; and an unditching beam.

Some current Type 79 tanks are fitted with a new sighting system, featuring a laser rangefinder integrated into the gun sight and fitted with new tracks with rubber pads.

Later production Type 79s include upgraded fire-control systems, a thermal imager and an electro-hydraulic hybrid 2-axis gun stabilizer. They also feature an expanded bustle rack similar to those equipping the Type 69-II.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
