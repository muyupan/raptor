This document describes the VTT-323 (M1973 Sinhung) North Korean Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The Sinhung VTT-323 armored personnel carrier (APC) is a North Korean license-built version of the Chinese Type 63 APC (see separate record). However, it has several alterations from its original that effectively make it a different vehicle.

It is designated the M1973 by the U.S. Army and nicknamed the "Vet." It uses the same chassis found in the PT-85 light tank and several other vehicles in North Korean service.

The welded steel hull is boxy in shape, with the turret placed behind the center-line of the vehicle. The driver sits in the front left of the vehicle, a single-piece hatch opening to the left above him, fitted with two day periscopes to the front. The commander sits to the driver's right with a single 360-degree view periscope and a single-piece hatch opening to the right.

The engine compartment is behind the commander, with the third crew member, the loader, seated behind the driver. The engine has air inlets and outlets on the roof and exhausts to the right side of the roof. A one-man turret holds the gunner and mounts either a 14.5-mm machine gun and a 7.62-mm MG, or twin 14.5-mm guns.

Another version carries a Susong-Po anti-tank guided-missile (ATGM) launcher (a variant of the Russian AT-3 Sagger ATGM) and SA-7/SA-16 man-portable surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). The turret is probably manually operated.

The vehicle can carry 10 fully equipped infantry and is the standard APC in North Korean service, organic to the motorized infantry battalions of tank and motorized infantry brigades. Infantry enter and exit the vehicle through a two-hinged door on the back of the hull. There are at least two firing ports provided on each side of the hull.

Fully amphibious, the vehicle must have a trim board affixed to the front of the hull, though this can be accomplished by the driver without leaving his seat. It is propelled through the water by its tracks.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Zimbabwe.
