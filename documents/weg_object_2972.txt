This document describes the M60A3 Patton American Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The M60A3 Patton American Main Battle Tank (MBT) appearance is almost indistinguishable from the M60A1. Two key indicators are a crosswind sensor (a small mast mounted atop the turret bustle), a cluster of smoke mortars on either side of the glacis plate, and a thermal sleeve (a pipe-like structure wrapped around the gun tube in front of the fume extractor). 

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey.

The Thermal Sight Gunner is Texas Instruments AN/VSG-2 tank thermal inder and Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (HgCdTe) IR detector for passive night and dust vision..
The Main Gun Stabilization is Add-On Stabilization (AOS) that was introduced in late 1972. This was an add-on kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. The add-on-stabilization system provides stabilization control for both gun elevation and turret traverse. It provides the gunner with the capability of aiming and target tracking and also improved surveillance of the battlefield terrain by the gunner while the tank is moving. It may be used in any one of three modes of control: (1) power-with-stabilization-on, (2) power-with-stabilization-off, and (3) manual. In the power-with-stabilization-on mode, the gunner's aim on target is automatically retained while the vehicle is in motion. This mode provides a fire-on the-move capability. The power-with-stabilization-off option eliminates needless exercise of the stabilization system and provides a back up power mode..
