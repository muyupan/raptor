This document describes the PF-89 (Type 89) Chinese 80mm Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher.

The PF-89 or Type 89 is a portable, disposable, unguided, shoulder-launched, anti-tank rocket-propelled rocket launcher. Developed by Norinco for the People's Liberation Army, PF-89 was designed to replace the obsolete Type 69 RPG, providing a man-portable, single-use assault weapon system that could be used primarily by infantry squads in order to engage and defeat light armor and bunkers. The design permits accurate delivery of a rocket-propelled 80mm High Explosive Anti-Tank warhead, with negligible recoil. PF-89 entered mass production in 1993 and generally replaced Type 69 RPG in PLA throughout the 1990s. Since 2010, the system is being used alongside the more advanced Type 08 recoilless gun.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Cambodia, China, Libya, Viet Nam.
