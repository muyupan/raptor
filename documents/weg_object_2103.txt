This document describes the AN/SSQ-47B American Active Non-Directional Sonobuoy.

The AN/SSQ-47B active buoy, also referred to as a ranger buoy, is the predecessor of the AN/ASQ-62 family. It automatically begins pinging upon water entry, and operates from fixed RF frequency channels at an RF power output of 1/4 Watt, depth settings being 60 or 800 feet. The sonic transmissions operate on one of six sonic frequencies in the 13.0 to 19.0 kHz band with an expected life of 30 minutes.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Spain, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
