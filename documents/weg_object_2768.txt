This document describes the M1977 HEMTT American 8x8 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) Common Bridge Transporter (CMT).

The M1977 Common Bridge Transporter (CBT) is a modified M977 HEMTT Cargo truck equipped with a Load Handling System (LHS). The M1977 CBT was designed to support the Engineer Corps in transporting all bridging assets. The M1977 CBT loads, launches and retrieves the Ribbon Bridge, Improved Ribbon Bridge and Heavy Dry Support Bridge utilizing the Bridge Adapter Pallet, (BAP) and associated bridge erection boats utilizing the Improved Boat Cradle (IBC). The CBT is equipped with a winch to assist in retrieving the deployed equipment.
The XM15 Bridge Adapter Pallet (BAP) is used to adapt the CBT for transport of Combat Engineer bridge equipment as mentioned above. When loaded, the BAP provides the necessary locks, rollers and guides to launch, retrieve and transport the bridge equipment. The BAP consists of the main frame and winch frame assemblies. The BAP is PLS compatible and is transloadable to/from the PLS trailer. The winch frame detaches from the BAP main frame and attaches to the CBT LHS. The winch frame utilizes the truck hydraulic power to winch the bridges during retrieval operations.
The XM14 Improved Boat Cradle (IBC) is used to adapt the CBT for transport of the Combat Engineer Bridge Erection Boat (BEB). When loaded, the IBC provides the necessary locks, rollers and guides to launch, retrieve and transport the BEB. The IBC is PLS compatible, similar to the flat rack in design and is transloadable to/from the PLS Trailer.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the M1977 HEMTT American 8x8 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) Common Bridge Transporter (CMT):
The M977 is The M977 cargo truck variant is the base member of the HEMTT family. The current model is the M977A4; there was no M977A1. In addition to the basic M977A0/A2/A4 cargo truck, two other variants are available. The M977A0/A2/A4 Electrical Power Plant (EPP) has an extended cargo body (6.041 m (19.82 ft) inside length) and is used to hold and transport generators for the Patriot air-defence missile system. There is no material handling crane on the EPP. The M977A0/A2/A4 Large Repair Parts Transporter (LRPT) and the basic M977 cargo truck are fitted with a light-duty Grove materials handling crane mounted at the rear of the chassis..
The M978 is The M978 is a 9,500 liter capacity tanker. The current model is the M978A4; there was no M978A1. The M978A0 was produced in both potable water (approximately 18) and fuel servicing truck variants, the A2 and A4 models have only been produced in the fuel servicing truck variant..
The M983 Tractor is The M983 is a tractor unit for use with the trailer-mounted MIM-104 Patriot missile system. It can also be used with the Interim Stryker Recovery System, or other trailers. An earlier variant fitted with a 30 kW generator and crane mounted behind the cab was used to tow the Pershing II Erector Launcher in CONUS (a M1001 MAN tractor was used in West Germany). The M983A2/A4 Light Equipment Transporter (LET) tractor is mainly used to transport construction and engineer equipment. It has a 45,000 lb (20,000 kg)) 2 speed hydraulic winch mounted behind the cab used to load the trailer. It does not have a self-recovery winch..
The M984A1 Wrecker is The M984 wrecker is the only HEMTT variant to have been produced in the A1 configuration, and this resulting in the change of recovery crane and retrieval system between A0 and A1 configurations. The current model is the M984A4. Standard equipment includes a 27,240 kg (60,050 lb) capacity two-speed recovery winch, a rear-mounted 11,340 kg capacity vehicle retrieval system, and a 6,350 kg (14,000 lb) at 2.74 m (9.0 ft) capacity Grove materials handling crane. A 9,072 kg (20,000 lb) bare drum capacity self-recovery winch is fitted as standard on the M984..
The M985 Cargo is The M985 is available in two variants. The current models are A4; there were no A1 models. The M985 cargo variant is similar to the M977 cargo truck but was developed to support the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) with a M989A1 HEMAT trailer. It may also used to transport Patriot missiles. The M985 Guided Missile Transporter (GMT) was developed specifically for use with the Patriot system and it can be distinguished easily from other cargo models by its rear-mounted Hiab 8108/2 materials handling crane.
The Taiwanese RT-2000 Multiple Rocket Launcher is The RT-2000 [Lit; Ray-Ting-2000 or Thunder -2000] rocket launcher mounted on an M977 chassis. In service about 1997. Can mount any one of three launchers: Mk 15 117-mm, 60 rounds; Mk 30, 30 rounds with HE; AP/AM cluster warhead - >18-mile range; Mk 45 12 rounds, > 27-mile range, GPS targeting. See separate record for details..
The M1120 HEMTT Load Handling System (LHS) is The M1120 Load Handling System (LHS) variant was initially introduced as part of the HEMTT overhaul/rebuild program, during which returned M977 cargo trucks have their cargo bodies and materials handling cranes removed, to be replaced by a Multilift Mark 5 (now designated MPH165-LHS) LHS, as fitted to the Oshkosh PLS truck..
The M1977 HEMTT Common Bridge Transporter (CBT) is The M1977 HEMTT Common Bridge Transporter (CBT) is a further development of the M1120 LHS, and in common with the M1120 LHS was initially introduced as part of the HEMTT overhaul/rebuild program. It is used for loading, transporting, and unloading Ribbon Bridge components and bridge erection boats..
The M1142 is The M1142 is a Tactical Fire Fighting Truck (TFFT) capable of extinguishing aircraft, petroleum, brush, and structural fires at isolated military installations.
