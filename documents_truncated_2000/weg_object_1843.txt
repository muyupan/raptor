This document describes the RGB-3 Russian Remote Sensing System.

Based on the Micro-MCA4 architecture, the RGB+3 is a remote sensing workhorse. This system consists of four cameras: one RGB color camera that senses broad bands of red, green, and blue; and three monochrome cameras that sense the following narrow bands: 680 nm, 700 nm, and 800 nm; these are generally understood as NDVI red, the "red edge," and NDVI NIR, respectively. This configuration allows you the advantage of an RGB color camera as well as very precise analyses, such as NDVI and SAVI, via the narrow bands.

The RGB+3 snap shutter sensors produce crisp images at very short exposures that are ideal for mosaic building or operation aboard fast or low-flying aircraft. The RGB+3 is equipped with standard Micro-MCA interfacing which includes a USB 2.0 interface for rapid system configuration and image transfer, a serial interface for tagging each image with GPS coordinates, live video interfacing, and a multi-IO connector (HDMI) with links to remote controls such as a remote image trigger.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
