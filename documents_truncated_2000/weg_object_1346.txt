This document describes the ZSU-57-2 (Ob'yekt 500) Russian 57mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun.

Hezbollah Proliferation. The ZSU-57-2 Ob'yekt 500 is a Soviet self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG), armed with two 57 mm autocannons. 'ZSU' stands for Zenitnaya Samokhodnaya Ustanovka, meaning "anti-aircraft self-propelled mount", '57' stands for the bore of the armament in millimeters and '2' stands for the number of gun barrels. It was the first Soviet mass-produced tracked SPAAG. In the USSR it had the unofficial nickname "Sparka", meaning "twin mount", referring to the twin autocannon with which the vehicle is armed.

Based on past experiences with SPAAG designs, Soviet engineers designed a vehicle that used a modified T-54 chassis, with four twin road wheels per side instead of five and much thinner armor. The vehicle was armed with twin 57 mm S-68 autocannon in a new, large, rotating, open-topped turret. The ZSU-57-2 consists of three compartments: driver's in the front, fighting in the middle, and engine transmission at the rear. The hull is more spacious in comparison with the T-54 because of the thinner armor and has different locations for some equipment. The general layout, with the transverse mounting of the engine, is the same

The driver's compartment is located on the left-hand side of the front of the hull. The driver's seat is moved forward and to the left in comparison with its location in the T-54. The compartment is equipped with a single-piece hatch cover opening to the left and two periscopic vision devices. One of them can be replaced by the TVN-1 infrared vision device which is operated together with the infrared headlamp (active night vision), which is mounted on the right track board. A fire-fighting equipment signal panel and a spare parts case are also located in the driver's compartment.

The open-topped box-type welded turret has a ball-bearing race ring 1850 mm in diameter. The turret rear can be removed, which makes the replacement of the guns easier. The turret can be covered in the traveling position by a tarpaulin which has 16 plexiglass windows.

To aim the guns, base data such as the target's speed, direction, and range must be entered into the sighting system by the sight adjuster, who sits to the left of the guns at the rear of the turret. The target's speed and direction is determined by visual estimation, while range can also be estimated visually or with the rangefinder. The upper front of the turret has two small ports with armored covers meant for collimators of the sight.

To fire the guns, the breeches must first be opened. The left and right loaders, located in the forward part of the turret on both sides of the main armament, load clips into the magazines of their respective weapons. The loaders' travel seats should be stowed in clamps on the turret sides before opening fire. The gunner, seated on the left-hand side in the middle of the turret, aims ("lays") the gun and opens fire using an electric trigger, which fires both barrels, or two-foot pedals, which can fire either barrel independently. If manual mechanical backup gun laying is used instead of electro-hydraulic drive, three crew members instead of two should work with the sight. The commander, who sits on the right-hand side in the middle of the turret, lays the gun in azimuth, the gunner in elevation, and the sight adjuster enters data into the sight. The loaders feed clips into the twin autocannon manually as needed, similar to the Bofors 40mm.

The twin S-68s are recoil-operated and weigh 4,500 kg. Their construction was based on two 57 mm S-60 AA autocannons. The guns have a recoil of between 325 and 370 mm. The individual weapons cannot be swapped from one side to the other as they are mirror images. Each air-cooled gun barrel is 4365 mm long (76.6 calibers) and is fitted with a muzzle brake. They can be elevated or depressed between −5° and +85° at a speed of between 0.3° and 20° per second, the turret can traverse 360° at a speed of between 0.2° and 36° per second. Drive is from a direct current electric motor and universal hydraulic speed gears (a manual mechanical drive is also provided in case of electrohydraulic failure; with the use of mechanical drive, elevation speed is 4.5° per second and the turret traverse speed is 4° per second).

The guns firing together are capable of firing up to 210–240 fragmentation and armor-piercing tracer (AP-T) shells per minute, with a practical rate of fire of between 100 and 140 rounds per minute.[3] Muzzle velocity is 1,000 m/s. Each clip has 4 rounds, each of which weighs 6.6 kg; the charge in each round consists of 1.2 kg of 11/7 nitrocellulose powder, a projectile weighs 2.8 kg. The maximum horizontal range is 12 km (with an effective range against ground targets of up to 4 km / 2.5 miles. the Maximum vertical range is 8.8 km with a maximum effective vertical range of 4.5 km / 14,750 ft). Fragmentation rounds have a safety destructor that activates between 12 and 16 seconds after being fired to ensure the shells won't fall back to the ground, so the maximum slant range of anti-aircraft fire is 6.5–7 km.[16] BR-281 armour-piercing rounds are able to penetrate 110 mm armor at 500 m or 70 mm armor at 2,000 m (at 90° impact angle).

The S-68 autocannon was the most powerful AA gun installed on SPAAGs at that time. According to the statistical data of the Air Defence Research Institute No. 2, a direct hit of a single 57 mm shell could destroy a contemporary jet aircraft. In order to shoot down a jet bomber of the Canberra type, an average of 1.7 hits was deemed necessary.

The vehicle carries 300 rounds, and the ammunition is stowed as follows: 176 rounds in clips inside the turret, 72 rounds in clips in the hull front, and 52 separate (unclipped) rounds in special compartments under the turret floor. Armour-piercing rounds in clips are placed in the rear part of the turret to the left and right of the guns. Empty shell cases and clips are removed via a conveyor belt through a special port in the turret rear into an external metal wire basket on the back of the turret.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Angola, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Hungary, Indonesia, Mozambique, Non-State Actors, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Sudan, Syria, Viet Nam.
