This document describes the JRTC VISMOD: Mi-17 (Hip H) Russian Medium Transport Helicopter.

The military variant Mi-17 (NATO reporting name: Hip) is a Soviet/Russian helicopter in production at two factories in Kazan and Ulan-Ude. It is known as the Mi-8M series in Russian service. It is a medium twin-turbine transport helicopter. There are also armed gunship versions. The improved version of the Mi-8 is the Mi-17 Hip multipurpose helicopter, also known as the Mi-8TMB. It is specifically designed for improved capabilities at high altitudes and in hot weather conditions.

The Mi-17 is identifiable from the Mi-8 by the additional air filters on the turbine air intakes, as well as left hand side mounted tail rotor, required by the more powerful TB-3-117A turbo-shaft engines it is fitted with. The Mi-17 can climb at the rate of 8m/s. The maximum and cruise speed of the helicopter are 250km/h and 225 km/h respectively. The range of the helicopter is 465 km and the service ceiling is 6,000m. The aircraft weighs around 7,489 kg and its maximum take-off weight is 13,000kg.


The Mi-8/17 have given rise to a bewildering range of versions that fulfill a wide variety of specialized roles. Dedicated combat support variants include airborne reserve command post, electronic counter measures (with onboard jammers), Communications intelligence and command relay. Other versions carry out delivery of fuel to front-line units, photo-reconnaissance, artillery fire-correction, reconnaissance, VIP transport, mine laying and mine clearing.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
