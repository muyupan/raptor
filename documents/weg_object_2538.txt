This document describes the AMX-10P French Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The AMX-10P is a French amphibious infantry fighting vehicle. It was developed after 1965 to replace the AMX-VCI in service with the mechanized regiments of the French Army; the first prototypes were completed in 1968. Production commenced between 1972 and 1973.

The AMX-10P is fully amphibious, being propelled through water at speeds of up to 7 km/h by twin waterjets. It is also fitted as standard with a trim vane and bilge pumps to assist with the flotation process. AMX-10Ps were popular with a number of Arab armies and have been operated by Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.[2] Special marine variants were also developed for Singapore and Indonesia, including a fire support model known as the AMX-10 PAC 90, which mated the AMX-10P chassis to the complete turret and 90 mm gun assembly of the Panhard ERC-90 Sagaie.

AMX-10Ps share a number of common transmission and chassis components with their armored car counterpart, the AMX-10RC.

AMX-10P hulls are fabricated from a welded steel or aluminum alloy[ and notable for their parallel incorporation of the driving and engine compartments. The driver is seated at the front of the vehicle and to the left. An AMX-10P's driving compartment is provided with a single hatch cover opening to the rear and three periscopes intended for observation purposes when the hatch is closed. Night vision equipment was not fitted as standard to the base production model; however, one of the three driving periscopes could be replaced with combined day/night intensification sights as needed. The troop compartment is at the rear of the hull and provided with two roof hatches. Passengers embark and debark from a ramp, which is accessed through two doors at the rear.

The transmission consists of a hydraulic torque converter coupled to a gearbox with one reverse and four forward driving gears. The AMX-10P utilizes a torsion bar suspension, which supports five road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and idler near the rear. These can be accessed from inside the hull through maintenance panels.

Standard AMX-10P turrets are equipped with a GIAT M693 automatic cannon firing two different types of both high explosive ammunition and armor-piercing ammunition. More than one ammunition type may be loaded at once and fired alternatively. The high explosive rounds have a muzzle velocity of 1,050 m/s, while the latest armor-piercing round has a muzzle velocity of 1,300 m/s and is capable of penetrating 20 mm of rolled homogeneous armor at an incidence of 60°. The autocannon has a cyclic rate of fire of 740 rounds per minute, with the gunner being able to switch between semiautomatic, limited burst, or fully automatic fire as necessary.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Indonesia, Iraq, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea (Republic of Korea).
