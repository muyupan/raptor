This document describes the Boragh Iranian Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

boragh or Boraq is an Iranian-made armored personnel carrier. Boragh is believed to be a reverse engineered and upgraded model of the Chinese Type 86 (BMP-1). The upgrades include a reduction in weight, a higher road speed, and stronger armor. The vehicle is fully amphibious and is fitted with an NBC protection system and infra-red night vision equipment.

It was reported in May 2002 that three additional variants are produced by the Vehicle and Equipment Group (VEIG) of the Iranian Defense Industries Organisation (DIO). These are a 120 mm mortar carrier, an ammunition resupply vehicle, and an armored personnel carrier (APC) fitted with improved armaments.

Boragh is a tracked APC. Rubber elements on the track are added to prevent damage on paved surfaces. It has a crew of three (driver, commander and gunner). It can transport up to 8 infantry soldiers. Boragh's main armament consists of the DShK 1938/46 12.7 mm heavy machine gun on a rotatable mount. Some vehicles have the machine gun mount protected all around by an armored shield. The vehicle is equipped with an NBC protection system and is capable of laying down a defensive smoke screen by injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust outlet.

The vehicle is named after the Buraq, a winged steed from Islamic mythology.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Sudan.
