This document describes the S-200 Dubna (SA-5 Gammon) Russian Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System.

The S-200 Volga (SA-5 Gammon**) is a Russian long-range, high-altitude strategic surface-to-air missile (SAM). It is a fixed-site, point defense SAM that relies on long-range early warning and ground control intercept radars (Big Back, Bar Lock, Tin Shield and Side Net ) for target tracking information and 5N62 series Square Pair** radar for fire control.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, Myanmar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Poland, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.
