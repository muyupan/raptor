This document describes the 2S3 Akatsiya (M1973) Russian 152mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

2S3 Akatsiya SO-152 (СО-152) is a Soviet 152.4 mm self-propelled gun developed in 1968. It was a response to the American 155 mm M109. The development started in 1967 according to the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on July 4, 1967. In 1968 the SO-152 was completed and in 1971 entered service. Its GRAU designation is 2S3 (2С3). The fighting vehicle also received the additional designation Akatsiya (Акация), which is Russian for acacia. The Akatsiya is armed with a 152.4 mm howitzer based on the Soviet 152.4 mm D-20 howitzer and is sometimes confused with the M109 self-propelled artillery. The artillery system was developed at design bureau No. 9 of Sverdlovsk. The factory designation of the howitzer is D-22 and the GRAU designation, 2A33. The chassis was developed by Uraltransmash.

The driver's and engine-transmission compartments are located in the front part of the hull, and the fighting compartment with a rotatory turret in the middle and rear parts of the hull. The armor is welded rolled steel. The SPG is equipped with an R-123 radio set, an R-124 intercom, an automatic CBRN defense system with a filtration unit, and fire-fighting equipment. The V-59 12-cylinder four-stroke water-cooled diesel engine connects to a mechanical two-gear transmission. The gearbox is combined into one block with planetary steering gear. The 2S3 has self-entrenching equipment which allows it to prepare a trench within 20–40 min.

The crew consists of 4–6 men: a driver, a gunner, a loader, a commander, and two ammunition bearers, which are positioned to the rear of the vehicle feeding rounds through two hatches in the hull rear when in masked firing position.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, CFE Treaty, Cuba, Ethiopia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Libya, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam.
