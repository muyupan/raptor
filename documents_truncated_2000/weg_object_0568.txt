This document describes the PLL-09 (Type 09) Chinese 122mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The PLL-09 is a Chinese 122 mm self-propelled howitzer. Currently, this howitzer is widely used by China's army. This artillery system is also used by China's marines.
The PLL-09 provides indirect fire support for rapid deployment brigades. These Chinese brigades are similar in concept to the US Stryker brigades. These military units are equipped with lightly armored, but highly mobile 8x8 armored personnel carriers of all variants. Each rapid reaction brigade has numerous armored vehicles of all variants, including armored personnel carriers, reconnaissance vehicles, 105 mm fire support vehicles, command vehicles, engineer vehicles, and some other specialized vehicles. These brigades can be briefly redeployed over significant distances. Also, the PLL-09 SPH has good cross-country mobility and is capable of keeping pace with main battle tanks.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
