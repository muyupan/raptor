This document describes the 1V152 FDC Kapustnik-B Russian 8x8 Amphibious Command and Fire Control Vehicle.

The 1V152 is called a “unified command vehicle;” of somewhat modular interior design, there are two versions of the 1V152, a FIST vehicle and an FDC vehicle.  Both carry the same designation, but have different equipment and different capabilities.

The BTR-80 1V152 version is used by battalion commanders and forward observers in field artillery units. This variant contains special navigation, range finding, and vision equipment.


The 1V152 FDC is the fire control component of the 1V152 system.  In its original iteration, the 1V152 FDC carries two data-capable long-range radios, a medium-range radio, and a short-range radio.  The 1V152 FDC has a limited computer able to compute fire solutions (though only two at a time), and use the data transmitted by FIST vehicles (manual input must be used).  The 1V152 FDC uses the same turret as the BTR-80 from which it derived, but that turret does not have the PKT coaxial machinegun.  On the roof is a 10-meter collapsible antenna, and several advanced whip antennas which are longer than normal whip antennas.  The original 1V152 FDC is equipped with an inertial navigation system with gyroscopic backup. It has a survey system to help lay out firing positions for the guns, mortars, or MRLs.  Newer 1V152 FDCs add a third long-range radio, a more capable computer able to calculate multiple fire solutions at once as well as fully and semi-automatically integrate information from FIST vehicles with much reduced user input.  The newer 1V152 FDC also adds a GLONASS system and a hand-held laser rangefinder to help determine proper firing positions for its guns, mortars, or MRLs; this laser rangefinder can be connected to the computer by a cable, and directly input its information.  The 1V152 also carries an assortment of manual aids to producing fire positions and determining firing positions, in case of equipment failure.  The 1V152 FDC carries an internal 4kW generator to power its electronics while the engine is turned off.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
