This document describes the Type 024 Class (Heku Class) Chinese Missile Boat.

The Type 024 missile boat is a Chinese built small missile boat armed with two anti-ship missiles and there were two versions developed. Although most have been placed in reserve, dozens remain in active service. Those in active service have been rearmed with C-101 supersonic anti-ship missiles.

The Heku class is the major version of Type 024 missile boat and it is also known as Hegu class, Hoku class, Hogu class, Hougu class and Houku class, depending on spelling and pronunciation. This class is the Chinese steel-hulled improvement over the original wooden-hulled Soviet Komar-class missile boat. The boat was designed by the 701st Institute at Wuhu while the missile launcher was designed by the 713th Institute. Since the delivery of the first unit by Wuhu Shipyard, around 80 were built in total, including export units. Ten of the Heku-Class were exported to Iran.

In addition to the development of the Heku class missile boat, another single unit of Type 024 missile boat with hydrofoils was also developed. This boat is called Homa class missile boat, but the design proved to be less satisfactory, and after serving in the People's Liberation Army Navy for evaluation, the unit was retired.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Iran (Islamic Republic of).
