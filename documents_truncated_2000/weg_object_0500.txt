This document describes the K-239 Chunmoo South Korean 130mm/227mm/239mm Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL).

The K239 Chunmoo, also called the K-MLRS (Korean Multiple Launch Rocket System), is a South Korean rocket artillery system.

The K239 is a self-propelled multiple rocket launcher (MRL) capable of firing several different guided or unguided artillery rockets. The launcher carries two launch pods that can hold three types of rockets: 20 130 mm unguided rockets, previously used on the K136 Kooryong, with a range of 36 km (22 mi) (40 total); six 227 mm unguided rockets, previously used on M270 MLRS vehicles operated by the South Korean Army, with a range of 45 km (28 mi) (12 total); and six 239 mm guided rockets designed for the system with a range of 80 km (50 mi) (some sources claim 160 km (99 mi), 12 total). The 239 mm rockets are 3.96 m (13.0 ft) long and GPS/INS guided with two modes of operation, impact bursting for use against personnel and delay bursting to destroy bunkers; it was a requirement of the ROK Army for the guided rocket to have a penetrator warhead to be used as a "bunker buster" solution against the large number of bunkers along the DMZ. Two different types of rocket pods can be loaded at once and the modular containers can be reloaded quickly. The launch vehicle is based on a Hanwha 8x8 truck chassis with an armored cab that protects its 3-man crew from small arms fire and artillery shell splinters as well as providing NBC protection. Each Chunmoo launcher is paired with an Ammunition Support Vehicle (ASV) using the same truck chassis carrying four reload pods. An ROK Army Chunmoo battery consists in 18 vehicles and uses the K200A1 as a command vehicle.

Development of the K239 began in 2009 and was completed in late 2013. South Korea's Defense Agency for Technology and Quality spent 131.4 billion won ($112.4 million) on the project to create a replacement for the K136 and initial production was carried out in August 2014. In October 2014, South Korea announced the purchase of 58 K-MLRS. In August 2015, the ROK Army began deploying the Chunmoo.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: South Korea (Republic of Korea).
