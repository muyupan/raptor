This document describes the Akula II-Class (Project 971U Class) Russian Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarine.

The AKULA-II class is a third-generation attack submarine whose design includes advanced quieting techniques for significantly reduced noise signature. These noise-reduction features reportedly reduce the sound levels to those of (or lower than) U.S. SEAWOLF and Improved LOS ANGELES classes.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
