This document describes the Type 74 Japanese Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The Type 74 tank is a main battle tank (MBT) of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). It was designed and built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Tokyo, Japan as a replacement for the Type 61 MBT. The Type 74 has an all-welded steel hull with an all-electric low, angular, and elongated turret.

The crew consists of 4 (commander, driver, gunner, and loader). The driver's station is located at the front left side of the hull. Both the commander and gunner occupies positions in the right side of the turret with the loader to their left. The engine compartment is located at the rear of the tank. 

An infrared searchlight is mounted to the left of the main gun and a pintle-mounted 12.7-mm anti-aircraft machine gun is located at the center of the turret in front of the commander's station. The MBT is equipped with infrared driving lights and a J3 infrared periscope for the commander.

One tank within a tank company is generally equipped with a dozer blade.

The Type 74 features an adjustable hydro-pneumatic suspension system that allows the driver or commander to adjust the first and the fifth road wheel stations. This unique feature enables the tank to be tilted six degrees forward or backward and nine degrees left or right. The tank can also be raised or lowered to maximum and minimum ground clearance. 

The is capable of fording water at a depth of 2.0 meters when equipped with a drum-type extension collar above the commander's hatch and two thin extensions to the exhaust pipes.

Several Type 74 tanks were observed in 1988 as being equipped with thermal sleeves for the 105-mm guns, thermal night-vision equipment , and armor on the top and forward positions of their turrets. Other possible upgrades include a laser-warning system on the roof, fire control modifications, the fitting of track skirts, and a modified rear drive sprocket.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Japan.
