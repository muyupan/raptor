This document describes the Y-9 Chinese Medium Transport Aircraft.

The Shaanxi Y-9 (Chinese: 运-9; pinyin: Yùn-9) is a medium military transport aircraft produced by Shaanxi Aircraft Company in China. It is a stretched and upgraded development of the Shaanxi Y-8F.

Development of the Y-9 may have begun as early as 2002 as the Y-8X program. The program was a collaborative effort with Antonov - the designers of the An-12 that it was ultimately derived from - and was aimed at competing with the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules. By September 2005, the Y-9 designation was being used. The Y-9 received design features originally intended for the Y-8F600; the Y-8F600 was cancelled in 2008.

Shaanxi had hoped to conduct the first flight as early as 2006, but it was delayed. Design changes were made in 2006,[3] with the design being frozen by January 2010. After the design freeze, it was suggested that the first flight would depend on securing a launch customer; construction had also not yet commenced. The aircraft finally flew in November 2010.

The Y-9 entered People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) service in 2012, with full operating capability being announced in December 2017.

The Y-9 is powered by four WoJiang WJ-6C turboprop engines. The propellers are six-bladed and made with Chinese JL-4 composites, and closely resemble the Dowty R406. The WJ-6C is replaced by the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150B in the Y-9E export variant.

The cruise speed is 300 knots (560 km/h; 350 mph) with an endurance of around 10.5 hours.

The Y-9 may carry 25 tons of cargo or about 100 paratroopers.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Myanmar.
