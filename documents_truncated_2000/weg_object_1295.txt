This document describes the 9K35 Strela-10 (SA-13 Gopher) Russian Short-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System.

The 9K35 Strela-10 (SA-13 Gopher) Russian Short-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System entered service in 1976. It is fully amphibious, NBC-equipped, and has a range-only radar. In the Russian Army, it has replaced the far less capable SA-9 'Gaskin' system on a one-for-one basis to improve the mobility of the anti-aircraft batteries in the Motorized Rifle and Tank Divisions. There are two versions of the SA-13 Transporter-Erector-Launcher And Radar (TELAR) variant of the MT-LBu vehicle in service, designated TELAR-1 and TELAR-2. The TELAR-1 carries four 'Flat Box-B' passive radar detection antenna units, one on either corner of the vehicle's rear deck, one facing aft, and one between the driver's vision ports at the front, whereas the TELAR-2 has none. The TELAR-1 is the command vehicle and supports one (1) SA-13 battery.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, India, Jordan, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Libya, Macedonia, Mongolia, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Serbia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Viet Nam.

Here is Variants information for the 9K35 Strela-10 (SA-13 Gopher) Russian Short-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System:
The Strela-10M is improved air defense missile system. It entered service with the Soviet Army in 1979. Its missile has improved guidance. It distinguishes targets from infrared decoys. Therefore it is more effective..
The Strela-10M2 is it is a further development of the Strela-10M. It can receive target data from air defense command posts or nearby radars. There is a 30-60% possibility to engage fighter aircraft with a single missile. Vehicle is fitted with floatation buoys on either side of the hull. It is fully amphibious and can ford rivers and lakes. On water it is propelled by its tracks. Amphibious speed on water is 5-6 km/h. It entered service with the Soviet Army in 1981..
The Strela-10M3 is is a further development of the system. It can additionally engage UAVs and cruise missiles. Missile has improved resistance to enemy countermeasures. Warhead contains 5 kg of explosive material instead of 3 kg. It is more efficient against small-size air targets, such as UAVs. These missiles weight 42 kg. These can be used by all other versions of the Strela-10. The Strela-10M3 entered service with the Soviet Army in 1989..
The Strela-10M3-K is a proposed Russian upgrade, based on refurbished BTR-60 APC 8x8 wheeled chassis..
The Strela-10M4 is is the latest version of the Strela-10 system designated 9K35M4 Strela-10M4. This is an upgrade package for the Strela-10M2 and earlier versions, in order to bring it up to the same standard as the Strela-10M3 system. The major improvements are a night/limited visibility sight with a maximum engagement range of 5,000 m and a significantly improved kill probability against F-4 and MiG-21 type targets..
