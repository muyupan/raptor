This document describes the CM-602G Chinese Short-Range Cruise Missile.

The CM-602G is a land-attack version of the C-602. It is advertised as having a range of 290 km (180 mi), a 480 kg (1,060 lb) penetrating blast/fragmentation warhead, and an inertial guidance system using GPS data which may be augmented to provide man-in-the-loop control.

The missile was revealed at the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in 2012.

The YJ-62 is a Chinese subsonic anti-ship cruise missile. It is manufactured by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation Third Academy. n a September 2014 article published in Joint Forces Quarterly, the YJ-62 is credited with a 210 kg (460 lb) warhead, a speed of Mach 0.6–Mach 0.8 (735–980 km/h; 457–609 mph), and a sea-skimming terminal attack height of 7–10 metres. The missile has an inertial guidance system using GPS and BeiDou data, and an active terminal sensor. YJ-62A is credited with a range of up to 400 km (250 mi; 220 nmi). In lieu of official data, the United States Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence believes it is likely the YJ-62 has a longer range than the 150 nautical miles (170 mi; 280 km) of the C-602 export version, at least 400 km.

The missile is deployed aboard Type 052C destroyers, and by coastal defence units using three-round transporter erector launchers.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
