This document describes the Type 072A-Class (Yuting II Class) Chinese Landing Ship.

The Type 072A-Class (Yuting II Class) Chinese Landing Ship is the latest member of the Type 072 series of landing ships. A total of 15 ships have been identified, with most of them assigned to the 6th Detachment of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) South Sea Fleet at Zhanjiang. They received the NATO reporting name of Yuting II. Derived from the Type 072III, the most obvious visual difference between the Type 072A and all earlier models of the Type 072 series is that the step of the stepped superstructure on all earlier models has been eliminated. In addition, the Type 072A is designed to accommodate air-cushioned landing craft by incorporating a deck well. Like its predecessor the Type 072III, the Type 072A has a helipad but no hangar. The Type 072A is designed to carry 10 tanks, 4 landing craft, a medium helicopter, and air-cushioned vehicles; a total of 250 fully armed troops can be carried.

The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Type 072A Yuting-II is a class of large landing ships developed as an enlarged version of the Type 072-III landing craft adding an aft helicopter deck for a medium-sized helicopter and more room for troops. The 5,000-ton class vessel propulsion system is based on two diesel engines developing a top speed of 21 knots. These ships can transport a payload of 500 tons and are provided with one dual 37mm gun to provide fire support during landing operations. The ship accommodates up to 250 fully equipped marines. The Type 072A ships carry four landing crafts, up to 10 tanks or 16 trucks. The PLAN commissioned 15 vessels built by Dalian Shipyard between 2003 and 2016.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
