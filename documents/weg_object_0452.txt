This document describes the Astros II Brazilian 127mm, 180mm, & 300mm Multiple Rocket Launcher.

The Astros (Artillery Saturation Rocket System) II is a modular multiple rocket launcher capable of firing three different caliber wrap-around fin rockets (for improved accuracy) using several types of warheads. The universal modules enable the system to accomplish fire missions with ranges from 9 to 90 kilometers. The Astros II system consists of the following vehicles: universal multiple launcher (AV-LMU), ammunition supply vehicle (AV-RMD), command and control vehicle/fire control unit (AVVCC), mobile workshops (for field maintenance), and the optional electronic fire control unit (AV-UCF). All of the Astros II vehicles use the Tectran Enginharia 10 ton, 6x6, wheeled vehicle chassis. A typical firing battery consists of six AV-LMU launchers, six AV-RMD ammunition supply vehicles, and one AV-VCC fire control unit. An AV-VCC command and control unit and two mobile workshops are found at battalion level. The battalion level AV-VCC can coordinate and direct fire missions for three Astros batteries. The AV-RMD ammunition supply vehicle carries two complete loads for each launcher.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Angola, Bahrain, Brazil, Indonesia, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia.
