This document describes the LVSR MKR15 American 10x10 Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Heavy Wrecker.

The Oshkosh LVSR MKR15 is a wrecker variant of the LVSR heavy high mobility truck. In 2011 US Marine Corps ordered nearly 70 of these heavy wreckers. First production vehicles were delivered in 2012. It replaces the Oshkosh Mk.48/15.

The Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) is a family of vehicles, based on a common 5-axle ten-wheel drive (10x10) chassis, that vary in individual configuration by mission requirements. The LVSR was designed and is manufactured by Oshkosh Defense. LVSR is a purpose-designed military vehicle and there are currently three variants in service, a cargo, a wrecker and a tractor truck.

The first LVSRs were ordered in 2006. The LVSR is the U.S. Marines’ equivalent of the U.S. Army’s Oshkosh Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) and Oshkosh Palletized Load System (PLS). The Marines do not use the HEMTT or PLS and the Army does not use the LVSR, but both services use a common trailer (M1076) with all three truck types.

The predecessor of the LVSR, the MK48 Logistics Vehicle System (LVS), had entered service with the US Marine Corps (USMC) from 1985 and in the late 1990s a project to replace the LVS was started.

As a precursor to a formal LVS replacement programme a number of manufacturers co-operated with the USMC to build and evaluate an Advanced Technology Demonstrator (ATD). The ATD was built during 1998 at the Nevada Automotive Test Centre (NATC). LVS Modification Demonstrators (LVS-MDs) were also built, these integrating commercially proven automotive components and technologies.

In April 2001, Logistics Management Institute (LMI) completed their final report for the 'Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the USMC Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), concluding the best option was to rebuy a vehicle similar to the technology demonstrator. Five alternative options had been considered, these were: Inspect and Replace Only As Necessary (IROAN) for the LVS; rebuild the LVS; re-manufacture the LVS to a higher standard; rebuy a vehicle similar to the technology demonstrator; research and develop an entirely new vehicle. Around this time it was suggested that 2,000-3,000 vehicles might be required, although throughout the program numbers would fluctuate.

An LVSR industry day was held in late 2001, and a formal solicitation to industry was released in early 2003. This had been delayed from an expected April 2002. The LVSR Request for Information (RfI) had originally been expected in May 2000.

In March 2004 Oshkosh Truck Corporation (now Oshkosh Defense) announced that the US Marine Corps had awarded the company a Phase I System Development and Demonstration Contract to supply three LVSR trucks. These were to be delivered to the Marines for extensive endurance and performance testing within 12 months.

This award was the first phase of a two-phase acquisition competition valued in March 2004 at $783 million for up to 1,581 vehicles. Competition for the Phase II production award (scheduled for March 2006) was limited to those companies that successfully completed Phase I evaluation. The other company selected for the Phase I evaluation was the American Truck Company (ATC) with a TATRA-based design.

Phase 1 testing was completed in 2005 and in late-May 2006, the USMC awarded the LVSR Phase II contract to Oshkosh Truck Corporation.

An initial LVSR order issued on 31 May 2006 was valued at $28 million and ordered 22 cargo, two wrecker (recovery), and tractor truck LVSR variants, plus vehicle kits, training (operator/maintainer-cargo), test support-production verification testing cargo, meetings, and contract data requirements.

The first LVSR cargo variant began testing at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in June 2007. Tractor and wrecker prototype vehicles began testing in November 2007 and April 2008 respectively. An additional 123 cargo variants, which completed low rate initial production (LRIP) quantities, were subsequently ordered under option year two of the production contract. In January 2009, Oshkosh announced an LVSR delivery order valued at $176 million. This called for more than 425 LVSRs and transitioned LVSR from LRIP into full-rate production (FRP).

LVSR fielding began in April 2009 for user trials and testing and the first vehicle was fielded to Afghanistan in September 2009. LVSR deliveries were completed in September 2013. Orders totalled 2,022, with the total order value around $965.78 million. Deliveries included 1,505 MKR18 cargo variants, 355 MKR16 tractor trucks, and 162 MKR15 wreckers.

The requirement for an LVSR companion trailer for the USMC has also been provided by Oshkosh. The M1076, which is already in service with the US Army, is the selected trailer. In May 2009, it was announced that the Marine Corps would receive an initial 30 M1076 PLST for use with the LVSR. By early 2016 the USMC had purchased a total of 687 PLST through a separate contract with the US Army.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.

Here is Protection information for the LVSR MKR15 American 10x10 Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Heavy Wrecker:
The Armor is It is fitted with an integrated armored cab and energy-absorbing seats..
The Applique Armor is Yes, The add-on armor kit for LVSR was developed and supplied by Plasan of Israel. Plasan was awarded a contract in mid-2006 for 12 LVSR armor kits for testing. The November 2011-stated AAO for LVSR add-on armor B-kits quotes 651.

The armor system for LVSR follows the A-kit/B-kit principle, with vehicles designed 'fitted for, but not with', protection. In the case of LVSR, 'fitted for' includes an armored cab floor as standard. Cargo and wrecker variants require an upgrade of the front springs. Protection kits can be installed and uninstalled from vehicles in the field using only basic tools. The A-kit is fitted on the production line and is the combination of a limited amount of armoring (in difficult-to-access areas of the vehicle), together with a significant amount of armour installation attachments and required support structures. The bulk of the armor, the B-kit, is installed in the field on an 'as required' basis.

The benefits of the A-kit/B-kit principle are that armor is only fitted when required, this reducing vehicle wear and tear, and by default whole life cycle costs. Improvements and/or upgrades to armor are also far easier to integrate into an appliqué solution. The A-kit/B-kit principle is currently applied to all current production US tactical 'soft skin' vehicles..
