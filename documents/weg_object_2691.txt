This document describes the M901 ITV American Anti-Tank Guided Missile Carrier.

The M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle) is an American armored vehicle introduced into service in 1979 and designed to carry a dual M220 TOW launcher. It is based on the ubiquitous M113 Armored Personnel Carrier chassis. The M901 ITV is no longer in service with the United States Army, its primary user.

The M901 ITV provides the crew and weapon system protection from small-arms fire and artillery fragments. The squad leader has a 270-degree range of view through the squad leader's periscope (SLP). The turret launcher has the capability for day and night acquisition and tracking of targets, and it provides firing coverages of 360 degrees in azimuth and +35 to âˆ’30 degrees in elevation. The ITV has stowage provisions for tripod-mounted TOW components configured so the ground system can be dismounted and set up in three to five minutes. In addition, the ITV is completely amphibious and is air transportable. It has the following characteristics:

* A hydraulically and electrically powered "hammerhead" turret, attached to a modified M27 cupola, that can be operated manually.

* A complete M220-series TOW weapon system stowed and strapped in fixed mounting brackets. The day sight tracker and night sight (AN/TAS-4 or AN/TAS-4a) are mounted in a ready state at the head of the turret. The missile guidance system is also connected at the base of the turret.

* A dual M220 TOW launcher.

* M243 smoke grenade launchers.

* A 3x acquisition sight with a 25-degree field of view.

* Remote actuators that allow day sight tracker and night sight adjustments.

* A machine gun mounted on a traversing rail.

The system is capable of firing two missiles without reloading and carries ten TOW rounds in the missile rack. Reloading is performed under armor protection and is accomplished by tilting the launching apparatus back so that the crew can reach the turret through the carrier's rear roof hatch. The missile launcher targeting head is at the end of a pivoting arm which raises the launcher assembly for firing. When stowed, the turret is aimed down and to the rear of the vehicle. A major limitation of the M901 is that it is practically unable to move while the turret is in a firing position and unable to fire while it is in the stowed position. A common workaround is to move the vehicle while the turret is in the loading position, thereby reducing the amount of time to get the turret in a fire position as opposed to the stow position. Moving from the firing to the stowed position is a procedure that takes several seconds and some skill on the part of the operator.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bahrain, Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal, Thailand, Tunisia.
