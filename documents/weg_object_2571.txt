This document describes the ZBD-04 (Type 04) Chinese Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The ZBD-04 (Type 04) Chinese Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) is the tracked infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) is based on the ZBD-97 IFV.
The tZBD-04 (Type 04) Chinese Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) is developed for the PLA in the late 1990s. The vehicle was designed to provide protected transport for an infantry squad on the battlefield; to provide fire support for dismounted infantry, and to engage enemy tanks and armored vehicles. The ZBD-04 is currently equipped by the amphibious mechanized divisions in South Military Region.

The ZBD-04 was designed as the successor to the Type 86 and has been in service with the PLA ground forces since 2006, in the armored units of the Guangzhou and Nanjing military regions. Besides the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) variant, an armored recovery vehicle (ARV) variant is also available. A further improved variant is known as the ZBD-04A.

The ZBD-04 has a crew of three (a commander, a driver, and a gunner) and is able to carry seven troops. The commander and gunner are seated in the two-man turret located in the middle, and the driver with one passenger is located in tandem to the left of the power compartment, located at the front right. Six infantrymen are located in the troop compartment at the rear.

There are firing ports in the left, right, and exit doors that allow infantrymen to fire assault rifles or light machine guns from inside the vehicle, even on the move. The vehicle has the amphibious capability, designed to swim to shore from a ship. For high-speed swimming, it has two large water jet ports.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
