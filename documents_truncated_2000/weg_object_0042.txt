This document describes the ZTZ-59D (Type 59D) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The ZTZ-59D (Type 59D) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT) was the first computerized version of the Type 59 series as well as the first version to feature ERA. It most closely resembles a modernized Russian T-55 although is lacking in firepower and mobility when compared with a T-72. Type 59D (also known as WZ-120D) is an upgrade with Type 59D1. The Type 59D has a longer 105 mm gun, called Type 83A, or Type 94. The gun has a range of 2000 m and may fire ATGMs out to 5500 m. A thermal sight is available.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Sudan, Viet Nam, Zimbabwe.

Here is Variants information for the ZTZ-59D (Type 59D) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The Type 59 is The basic variant, a T-54A clone without IR searchlight. Entered production in 1957..
The Type 59-I is Improved variant fitted with a Type 69-II 100 mm rifled gun, as well as a laser rangefinder, hydraulic servo-system, primitive fire-control system, automatic fire suppression system, and rubber track skirt. The Type 59-I includes several versions with different armor and fire control configurations..
The Type 59-II is This version was fitted with a two-axis, stabilized, a rifled 105-mm gun with a fume extractor and thermal sleeve. The Chinese-made gun is very similar to the British L7/U.S. M68 105-mm tank gun.
The Type 59 II also has a 580-hp diesel engine, a light spot fire-control system, and an automatic fire extinguisher. New radios and communication systems were installed. It is known to U.S. forces as Model 1984, representing the first year it was identified.  Mass increased to 36.5 tonnes..
The Type 59D1 is The Type 59D1 (also known as WZ-120C) is an upgrade with explosive reactive armor, computerized stabilized fire-control system, the 105 mm. gun of the Type 59-II, and a night vision system.
The Type 59G is An upgrade of the Type 59, featuring a redesigned turret and armor. It uses a turret similar to that of the Type 96A, a 125 mm gun, modern fire control systems, arrow-shaped armor, spaced armor, and possibly third-generation subsystems..
The Jaguar is The Jaguar was a prototype vehicle based on the Type 59 chassis that was jointly developed by the United States and China during the 1980s, made possible by the US-Chinese détente of the 1970s. Planned to replace China's existing tank fleet, as well as for the export market, the tank featured improvements to the standard Type 59's engine, armament, armor, turret, optics, electronics, fire control, and suspension. Following Tiananmen Square massacre, American-Chinese relations soured and the Chinese withdrew from the project. The Americans continued alone and successfully completed the design, however, the end of the Cold War saw a glut in the international tank market, and thus no orders were ever placed for the vehicle.
The Type 62 Light Tank is In the late 1950s, the PLA submitted requirements for a light tank more suitable for operations in China's southern region. Development on the new Type 62 tank began in 1958, which was a scaled-down Type 59 MBT with simplified equipment. The Type 62 light tank entered batch production in 1963, and approx. 800 were produced by 1978. The Type 62 light tank weighs only 21 tons and is equipped with a Type 62-85TC 85 mm rifled gun, and 3 machine guns. An improved Type 62-I version was produced with better FCS with laser rangefinder and turret storage racks for added protection. Other versions based on the Type 62 include the Type 79 recovery vehicle (prototype only) and Type 82 earth-mover.

The PLA deployed the Type 62 light tank to Vietnam during the 1979 Sino-Vietnam conflict. They found that the thin armor of the Type 62 tank could be penetrated easily by hand-held anti-tank weapons, such as the 40 mm RPG. The Type 62 tank suffered severe losses during the conflict, which convinced the PLA to develop new second-generation MBTs. The Type 62 tank received a major upgrade in 2000, with a new welded turret, vertically stabilized 105 mm rifled gun, fire-control system, night vision device, smoke grenade launchers, and explosive reactive armor (ERA) package.
The Type 69 / 79 is Improved Type 59 MBT built by 617 Factory (Inner Mongolia First Machine Group Co. Ltd). Only saw limited service in the PLA, but was an export success in the 1980s with more than 2,000 sold worldwide..
The Type 73 is This armored recovery vehicle is a Type 59 with its turret removed. The vehicle is armed with a single 12.7 mm machine gun. This armored recovery vehicle is not believed to have a winch and is limited to towing operations..
The Type 59 Heavy Infantry Fighting Vehicle is The modernized HIFV model of Type 59 weighs around 40 tons and can carry up to seven passengers. Modifications include moving the engine to the front of the vehicle chassis, increasing tank armor including explosive reactive armor on all sides, and installing a rear door for dismounting infantry..
The QN-506 is It is a modernized variant of the Type 59 using the tank's chassis similar to its Russian counterpart the BMPT Terminator. The vehicle was first appeared at the Zhuhai Air Show in China in November 2018 and is armed with two QN-502C anti-tank missiles, ten QN-201 multi-purpose mini-missiles, four S-507 loitering munitions, and unmanned 30 mm cannon, a 7.62 mm machine gun, six grenade launchers, and a quadcopter surveillance drone.
The Type T-72Z is Iran version..
The Kok'san is North Korea version..
The Al-Zarrar is Pakistan version.  Heavy Industries Taxila of Pakistan has introduced the Al-Zarrar Main Battle Tank. The Al-Zarrar series was designed to improve and rebuild the Pakistani army's Type 59 tanks by way of more modern armament, fire control, defensive equipment, etc. Improvements include:
