This document describes the ACMAT VLRA French 4x4 Light Utility Truck.

ACMAT (Ateliers De Construction Mécanique De L'atlantique, also known as ALM-ACMAT) since 22 May 2006 is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renault Trucks. Known for their reliability, simplicity, ruggedness, and their 80% (over 3,500) commonality of parts across the entire product line, these vehicles were originally targeted at African and Asian countries that could not afford more expensive vehicles. The ACMAT company built their vehicles based on standardization, commonality of parts and components, and on interchangeability; parts are interchangeable with vehicles built 30 years ago. Parts commonality includes cabs, structural components, engines, and drive trains. ACMAT uses many of the same parts for all of its line of vehicles.

The VLRA series of tactical military trucks has been developed especially for reconnaissance, escort, and support duties. It is also used as a heavy patrol vehicle, equipped for long reconnaissance missions. All VLRA variants have full-time all-wheel drive and an integrated water tank that holds 200 liters of drinking water.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Botswana, Chad, Chile, Cyprus, France, Ireland, Kenya, Mali, Morocco, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Zimbabwe.
