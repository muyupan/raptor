This document describes the Sonya-Class (Project 1265 Yakhont Class) Russian Coastal Minesweeper.

The Sonya class is a group of minesweepers built for the Soviet Navy and Soviet allies between 1971 and 1991. The Soviet designation is Project 1265 Yakhont. The Sonya-class ships are wooden-hulled coastal minehunters, built as successors to the Vanya class with new sweeps and more effective sonar. A central safe explosion-proof area is fitted and all key systems can be remote-controlled from there.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Cuba, Ethiopia, Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine, Viet Nam.
