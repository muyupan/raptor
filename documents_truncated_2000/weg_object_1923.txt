This document describes the M79 Osa Yugoslavian 90mm Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher.

The M79 Osa (Serbian: Оса; "wasp") is a Yugoslav-made portable 90 mm anti-tank weapon made of fiber-reinforced plastics. It resembles the French portable anti-tank launcher 89 mm LRAC F1. It consists of the launcher, a CN-6 sighting piece, rocket, and carrying case for the rocket. The M79 shoots unguided projectiles in direct sight and is effective against armored fighting vehicles and fortifications.

The M79 Osa is operated by a two-man team, an operator, and a loader. The loader inserts the rocket container through the rear of the launcher. The operator then takes aim at the target through the CN-6 sight. The CN-6 sight has 3.5x magnification and a 10-degree field of view. It also features anti-laser filters to protect the operator from blinding battlefield lasers. When the trigger is pressed, the rocket motor is filed electronically. The rocket leaves the launcher at a speed of approximately 250 meters per second. It is accurate enough to be used against armored vehicles at a range of 350 meters and can engage larger stationary targets up to 600 meters away.

On impact, a piezoelectric impact fuse in the rocket triggers the shaped charge warhead, which can penetrate up to 400 millimeters of armor. The fuse is sensitive enough to trigger the warhead at impact angles up to 70 degrees from the vertical. After firing, the spent rocket container is removed from the launcher, and a fresh tube is attached.

The M79 Osa was designed and manufactured by Sloboda Čačak in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It has continued production in Serbia, North Macedonia, and in Croatia as the RL90 M95.

A large number of M79 OSA rocket launchers have been supplied to rebels in Syria which have been proven effective in deterring the Syrian Army's armor. Many have mistaken the M79 supplied to the rebels in Syria for the Russian RPG-29 rocket launcher, which is also seeing use. M79 Osa's are also used in Iraq by Islamic State against the Iraqi army and JANES has reported their use against US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia.
