This document describes the AH-64DJP Apache Japanese Attack Helicopter.

The AH-64DJP is the Fuji Heavy Industries licensed version of the U.S. twin-turboshaft AH-64D Apache Attack Helicopter. It has the capability of mounting the Raytheon air-to-air Stinger missile, new navigation and communications equipment and the option to fit a ski landing gear.

The aircraft is powered by a pair of upgraded T700-GE-701C engines. It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems. It is armed with a 30 mm (1.18 in) M230 chain gun carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. The AH-64DJP has significant systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.

It is equipped with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once; an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches, allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Japan.
