This document describes the M113A2 American Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The M113A2 replaced the M113A1 in production in 1979. It has improved engine cooling equipment and reinforced suspension. A total of 5 300 M113 and 12 700 M113A1 APCs were upgraded to the A2 standard in the USA.

In 1979, further upgrades were introduced. Engine cooling was improved by switching the locations of the fan and radiator. Higher-strength torsion bars increased ground clearance, and shock absorbers reduced the effects of ground strikes. Armored fuel tanks were added externally on both sides of the rear ramp, freeing up 0.45 cubic meters (16 cu ft) of internal space. The weight of the M113A2 was increased to 11,740 kilograms (25,880 lb). Because the added weight affected its freeboard when afloat, it was no longer required to be amphibious. Four-tube smoke grenade launchers were also added. The suffix A2 is used on all variants to denote an upgrade to the A2 standard.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Portugal, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, United States of America.
