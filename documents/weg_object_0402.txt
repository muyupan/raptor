This document describes the 2A45M (Sprut-B) Russian 125mm Self-Propelled Towed Anti-Tank Gun.

The 2A45M (Sprut-B) Russian 125mm Self-Propelled Towed Gun is based on the carriage of the Russian D-30 (122 mm) howitzer with modified D-81 ordnance, which can engage targets at a maximum range of 2,100 m indirect fire mode and 12,200 m in indirect fire mode.

A feature of the Sprut-B is its integrated engine, which can propel the gun on relatively flat surfaces (up to 15 degrees of slope) and at 14 km/h on roads. This gives the gun a measure of mobility on the battlefield. It takes two minutes to go from the firing position to the traveling position and 90 seconds to go from the traveling position to the firing position. Such guns are known in Russian as "self-moving" (самодвижущиеся) as opposed to self-propelled (самоходные), and outside of battle, it is towed by an MT-LB.

The gun features a crew of seven. An OP4M-48A direct fire sight is used during the day, while a 1PN53-1 night-vision sight is used at night. For indirect fire, 2Ts33 iron sights are used, along with a PG-1m panoramic sight. The gun can reliably engage targets two meters high at a distance of 2,000 meters.

The barrel features a thermal sleeve to prevent temperature changes affecting the accuracy. The gun uses the same semi-fixed ammunition as the T-64, T-72, T-80, and T-90 tanks.

With the addition of the 9S53 laser fire-control system, the gun can fire laser-guided projectiles such as the 9M119 Svir or 9K120 Refleks.


The 2A45M is believed to be capable of firing the AT-11 SNIPER (Svir) laser beam riding, antitank guided missile which has a maximum range of 4000 meters.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Mexico, Russian Federation, Ukraine.
