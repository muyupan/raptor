This document describes the PLZ-89 (Type 89) Chinese 122mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The PLZ-89 (Type 89) Chinese 122mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH) is used by the People's Liberation Army of China to replace Type 85 and Type 70 122 mm self-propelled howitzer. PLZ-89 was first unveiled to the public during the 1999 National Day military parade.

Since the late 1970s, a number of 122 mm self-propelled howitzers were developed in China to meet Chinese Army requirements. The PLA required a mobile artillery system to provide medium- to long-range indirect fire support for motorized infantry and armored troops capable of keeping pace with them. However, none of them could meet these requirements. The Type 89, also known as the PLZ89, the self-propelled howitzer was developed in the late 1980s. It was a Chinese attempt to develop indigenous SPH with similar capabilities to the Soviet 2S1 Gvosdika. Type 89 is currently in service with the Chinese Army and Marines. Several hundred of these artillery systems were built.

The Type 89 SPH is armed with a 122 mm / L32 howitzer. It is a variant of the towed Type 86 (W-86), which in turn is a copy of the Soviet D-30 towed howitzer. Type 89 is fitted with a semi-automatic loader. This artillery system is compatible with Chinese and Russian 122 mm ammunition. The maximum range of fire is 18 km using standard HE projectile and 21 km with extended-range projectiles. The vehicle is fitted with a computerized fire control system.

The secondary armament consists of a roof-mounted 12.7-mm machine gun. The armor of Type 89 provides protection against small arms fire and artillery shell splinters. The vehicle is fitted with NBC protection and automatic fire suppression systems. Type 89 uses a tracked chassis, developed from the Type 77 amphibious armored personnel carrier. The vehicle is powered by the 12V150L12 diesel engine, developing 450 hp. Type 89 can be fitted with a flotation kit for amphibious operation.

Gun for PLZ-89 is mounted on a tracked chassis that developed from a Type 77 amphibious armored personnel carrier and the main armament is derived from the Type 86 (W-86) 122 mm / 32 caliber towed howitzer, which itself is a Chinese copy of the Russian D-30 122 mm howitzer. PLZ-89 carries 40 rounds inside the turret and it can fire all types of Chinese and Russian 122 mm rounds. The gun is equipped with a semi-automatic loader with a maximum rate of fire of 6~8 rounds/min and fire accuracy is achieved by a digital fire-control system and a roof-mounted electro-optical sighting for day/night operations. The five crew members are protected by collective anti-NBC systems and automatic fire suppression. The howitzer can swim with the assistance of certain floating devices.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the PLZ-89 (Type 89) Chinese 122mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH):
The SH3 is Is an improved version of the Type 89, developed for export. It can be seen as a China's newly-built equivalent to the Soviet 2S1 Gvosdika. It offers greater mobility, improved fire control system and delivers greater firepower than the 2S1 or the Type 89 self-propelled howitzers. The SH3 has been exported to Rwanda..
The PLZ-07 is Is a successor of the Type 89. This artillery system is widely used by the China's army. It utilizes a similar 122 mm howitzer, but has a new tracked chassis. It has greater mobility, improved fire control system and delivers greater firepower than its predecessor. This artillery system was adopted by the Chinese army in the late 2000s and is fielded in large numbers..
