This document describes the MCRS HEMTT American 8x8 Modular Catastrophic Recovery System (MCRS).

Modular Catastrophic Recovery System (MCRS)

The US Army, with Tru-Hitch Inc., has fielded the Modular Catastrophic Recovery
System (MCRS). This system incorporates the Fifth Wheel Towing and Recovery
Device (FWTRD), which engages into the Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer (TDRT). This
system provides a full range of recovery capability.
The Fifth Wheel Towing and Recovery Device (FWTRD) is equipped with a
dedicated 35K winch and boom spade caps to provide a stable platform for
recovery winching. The prime mover’s heavy duty 45K winch can also be utilized
with the FWTRD for winch recovery .
The Fifth Wheel Towing and Recovery Device (FWTRD) can lift 32,000 lbs and tow
up to 150,000 lb. GCW with optimal weight distribution.
The Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer (TDRT) is capable of transporting up to 35 tons and
offers high ground clearance and yet low center of gravity. 

What makes the Tru-Hitch FWTRD unique is that it imposes a downward load on the prime mover at
the fifth wheel rather than from behind the prime mover. Thus, towed weight is evenly distributed
on all axles of the prime mover. The operator maintains safe steering and braking of the prime
mover and the vehicle in tow. Because the load pivots at the fifth wheel, turning ability and off-road
mobility are significantly better than that of other recovery systems. The FWTRD can be utilized
independently of the Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer (TDRT) to lift tow a full compliment of wheeled
vehicles, including MRAP and STRYKER.

For recovery, the FWTRD booms with boom
caps, are set as spades. The winch cable is fed
through a sheave mounted at the top of the
FWTRD mast. This high vantage point and
extremely stable platform maximize the winches
capability. The prime mover’s heavy duty 45K
winch, the FWTRD 35K, or a combination of
both winches can be utilized for straight pulls.

The FWTRD engages into the
Tilt Deck Recovery Trailer (TDRT).
The axles of the TDRT slide forward
allowing the bed to tilt to the rear
for loading. Deck width is
expandable from 102” to 114” to
accommodate wider vehicles. 

Disabled vehicles are winched onto the
TDRT deck. The TDRT deck is specifically
designed for severe service. 

With the TDRT axles slid to transport
position, the load is safely moved.
Recover, Lift-Tow, Transport.
The Modular Catastrophic Recovery
System (MCRS) performs the full
range of recovery functions.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the MCRS HEMTT American 8x8 Modular Catastrophic Recovery System (MCRS):
The M977 is The M977 cargo truck variant is the base member of the HEMTT family. The current model is the M977A4; there was no M977A1. In addition to the basic M977A0/A2/A4 cargo truck, two other variants are available. The M977A0/A2/A4 Electrical Power Plant (EPP) has an extended cargo body (6.041 m (19.82 ft) inside length) and is used to hold and transport generators for the Patriot air-defence missile system. There is no material handling crane on the EPP. The M977A0/A2/A4 Large Repair Parts Transporter (LRPT) and the basic M977 cargo truck are fitted with a light-duty Grove materials handling crane mounted at the rear of the chassis..
The M978 is The M978 is a 9,500 liter capacity tanker. The current model is the M978A4; there was no M978A1. The M978A0 was produced in both potable water (approximately 18) and fuel servicing truck variants, the A2 and A4 models have only been produced in the fuel servicing truck variant..
The M983 Tractor is The M983 is a tractor unit for use with the trailer-mounted MIM-104 Patriot missile system. It can also be used with the Interim Stryker Recovery System, or other trailers. An earlier variant fitted with a 30 kW generator and crane mounted behind the cab was used to tow the Pershing II Erector Launcher in CONUS (a M1001 MAN tractor was used in West Germany). The M983A2/A4 Light Equipment Transporter (LET) tractor is mainly used to transport construction and engineer equipment. It has a 45,000 lb (20,000 kg)) 2 speed hydraulic winch mounted behind the cab used to load the trailer. It does not have a self-recovery winch..
The M984A1 Wrecker is The M984 wrecker is the only HEMTT variant to have been produced in the A1 configuration, and this resulting in the change of recovery crane and retrieval system between A0 and A1 configurations. The current model is the M984A4. Standard equipment includes a 27,240 kg (60,050 lb) capacity two-speed recovery winch, a rear-mounted 11,340 kg capacity vehicle retrieval system, and a 6,350 kg (14,000 lb) at 2.74 m (9.0 ft) capacity Grove materials handling crane. A 9,072 kg (20,000 lb) bare drum capacity self-recovery winch is fitted as standard on the M984..
The M985 Cargo is The M985 is available in two variants. The current models are A4; there were no A1 models. The M985 cargo variant is similar to the M977 cargo truck but was developed to support the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) with a M989A1 HEMAT trailer. It may also used to transport Patriot missiles. The M985 Guided Missile Transporter (GMT) was developed specifically for use with the Patriot system and it can be distinguished easily from other cargo models by its rear-mounted Hiab 8108/2 materials handling crane.
The Taiwanese RT-2000 Multiple Rocket Launcher is The RT-2000 [Lit; Ray-Ting-2000 or Thunder -2000] rocket launcher mounted on an M977 chassis. In service about 1997. Can mount any one of three launchers: Mk 15 117-mm, 60 rounds; Mk 30, 30 rounds with HE; AP/AM cluster warhead - >18-mile range; Mk 45 12 rounds, > 27-mile range, GPS targeting. See separate record for details..
The M1120 HEMTT Load Handling System (LHS) is The M1120 Load Handling System (LHS) variant was initially introduced as part of the HEMTT overhaul/rebuild program, during which returned M977 cargo trucks have their cargo bodies and materials handling cranes removed, to be replaced by a Multilift Mark 5 (now designated MPH165-LHS) LHS, as fitted to the Oshkosh PLS truck..
The M1977 HEMTT Common Bridge Transporter (CBT) is The M1977 HEMTT Common Bridge Transporter (CBT) is a further development of the M1120 LHS, and in common with the M1120 LHS was initially introduced as part of the HEMTT overhaul/rebuild program. It is used for loading, transporting, and unloading Ribbon Bridge components and bridge erection boats..
The M1142 is The M1142 is a Tactical Fire Fighting Truck (TFFT) capable of extinguishing aircraft, petroleum, brush, and structural fires at isolated military installations. The TFFT is based on a HEMTT M977A2 chassis with the heavier duty M1120 LHS HEMTT variant rear suspension. The TFFT contract was awarded to Pierce Manufacturing with Oshkosh Corporation as a subcontractor to Pierce..
