This document describes the RBS-15 Swedish Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile.

The RBS-15 (Robotsystem 15) is a long-range fire-and-forget surface-to-surface and air-to-surface, anti-ship missile. The later version Mk. III has the ability to attack land targets as well. The missile was developed by the Swedish company Saab Bofors Dynamics.

The missile was developed from the RB 04 missile that was used by the Swedish air force. The front of the missile was retained, including the warhead, but the rear received new wings and a turbofan engine replaced the rocket previously used. The RBS-15 underwent trials on the missile FAC HMS Piteå from 1983 and became operational with the Swedish Navy in 1985. The Västergötland class submarines were to have 4 vertical missile launch tubes for RBS-15 missiles in an extended hull, canceled due to budget constraints and to not fitting the way Swedish submarines operated.

In March 2017 Saab received an order for a new generation anti-ship missile to replace the RBS-15. The order is valued at 3.2 billion SEK and deliveries will take place between 2017–26. The new missile will have better range, a better seeker and lower weight. It will have the ability to knock out a wide range of sea and land targets, all-weather capability and a design that allows for future upgrades.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Thailand.
