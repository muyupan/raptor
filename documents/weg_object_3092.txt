This document describes the AX50 British 12.7mm Anti-Material Rifle.

The AX50 is a sniper rifle developed by British firearms manufacturer Accuracy International. Devised as an upgrade, it is the latest iteration of the AW50 rifle and is built to withstand sustained, heavy usage. Inheriting all the attributes of its predecessor, it allows the operator a high level of accuracy and performance in the harshest of conditions.

The AX50 is a variant of the AX series of sniper rifles that entered production in 2010. Fabricated by Accuracy International to meet the modern demands of military and police units alike and was designed with long range precision accuracy in mind for a more accurate anti-materiel weapon. According to Accuracy International the development of the series was partly influenced by the Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) U.S. Special Operations Command solicitation. An undertaking by the U.S. military for a new and improved Precision long range rifle. Although the contract was lost to Remington's Modular Sniper Rifle.

The AX50 is a bolt-action, .50 BMG sniper/anti-material rifle weighing 12.5 kg (27.6 lb), and is 1,370 mm (53.9 in) in overall length with a 685.8 mm (27.0 in) free floated barrel that can be changed in less than 10 minutes. The rifle itself is built on an aluminum chassis, and has a stock which can be folded to the left to shorten the overall length of the rifle when needed, and features a two-stage trigger with a 3.3 to 4.4 lbs. adjustible pull. The receiver and bolt featuring a 60° bolt throw are made of steel. The AX50 comes with an integrated Piccatinny rail as well as a "Firing pin cocking indicator" safety allowing the user to ascertain whether a cartridge is chambered. Accuracy International actively promotes fitting the Schmidt & Bender PM II / MILITARY MK II product line as sighting components on their sniper rifles and sells these telescopic sights as accessories, which is rare for a rifle manufacturer.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, Denmark, Malaysia, Peru, Singapore, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
