This document describes the Pokpung-ho North Korea Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The P'okp'ung-ho or spelled Pokpung-ho (Korean: 폭풍호) is a North Korean main battle tank (MBT) developed in the 1990s. The tank may incorporate technology found in the T-62, T-72, and Ch'onma-ho MBTs. Outside parties codename the tank M-2002 because the tank went through performance trials on February 16, 2002 (therefore being officially confirmed by outside sources), although the tank may have been in existence since 1992.

The P'okp'ung-ho is only known to be used in North Korea.

Unclassified images of the P'okp'ung-ho finally surfaced in 2010, which showed the tank design appeared to be developed from the later models of the Chonma-ho and influenced by the T-72. The P'ok'pung-ho has better mobility, survivability, and firepower than the Ch'onma-ho. Capabilities of the tank have been speculated to be nearly identical to T-90, however, the limited access to technical information regarding the P'okp'ung-ho makes accurate comparisons difficult.

The P'okp'ung-ho's primary armament was almost certainly the 2A20 115mm gun in early examples; however, later versions seemed to be armed with the 2A26/2A46 125mm smoothbore gun, which fires AP rounds produced in North Korea. The tank also has a heavy KPV anti-aircraft machine gun and a coaxial machine gun, as well as four smoke grenade launchers on each side of the turret. The tank does not have the capability to fire ATGMs from its main gun. A model displayed at an April 2017 parade was equipped with two MANPADS launchers at the rear of the turret, two ATGM launchers mounted on the left side of the turret, and twin automatic grenade launchers mounted on the right side of the commander hatch.

Although the engine compartment and the layout show some resemblance to a T-72 hull, the chassis is basically a heavily modified version of T-62, with greater length and an additional pair of road wheels. The glacis plate of the Pokpung-ho is heavily sloped and protected by appliqué armor in the initial version with ERA added in later versions. The turret is reinforced with wedge-shaped armor modules in Pokpung-Ho I and seems to be protected by composite armor similar to the later export variant T-72M1 in Pokpung-Ho II with ERA added in Pokpung-Ho III. The panels along the tracks seem to be made of light laminar armor.

Although the horsepower of the P'okp'ung-ho's engine has been speculated to be as high as 1500, the engine is likely to have around 1000-1100 horsepower. It has been reported that North Korea rejected developing the 1,250 hp (930 kW) engine of the T-80, judging that it would not be suitable for a tank engagement within the narrow, mountainous terrain of Korea and that it would prove to be of little difference on defensive missions. During aggressive missions, the P'okp'ung-ho can quickly engage the enemy due to its already excellent speed and acceleration, which is the basis of North Korean tank tactics.

The fire control system of the P'okp'ung-ho is relatively modern and based on the presence of a meteorological mast is almost certainly computerized, and some reports claim that it may be based on the Chieftain FCS, which Iran may have illegally exchanged for North Korean technology. If the P'okp'ung-ho's FCS is based on the T-72's, it may implement the PNK-3 or PNK-4 day and night sighting system with the 1K13-49 periscope combined passive/active sight guidance system. However, the night sighting system is most likely to be the same with obsolete T-62. The quality of the equipment is likely inferior to the South Korean counterparts.

The P'okp'ung-ho also has an infrared sensor (TPN-3-49 or TPN-4), a laser rangefinder, and a searchlight, all of which allow the P'okp'ung-ho to operate during the night. Although the quality of the equipment is likely inferior to the South Korean counterparts, the P'okp'ung-ho is believed to be a considerable threat at medium/short-range engagements, although lacking when firing from long ranges at night.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).

The Pokpung-Ho I is The initial variant. Armed with the 115 mm 2A20 gun from the T-62 series and equipped with applique and spaced armor. First observed publicly during the spring of 2010..
The Pokpung-Ho II is A variant with heavily improved armament and protection, the Pokpung-Ho II mounts a 125 mm 2A26/46 smoothbore gun and has a new turret seemingly augmented with composite armour. ERA was also fitted on the front glacis. First observed publicly during the October 10, 2010 military parade. SA-7 MANPADS can also be fitted..
The Pokpung-Ho III is Currently the most advanced variant of the Pokpung-Ho, this version possesses most of the traits of the Pokpung-Ho II but has additional reactive armour on the turret front and forward part of the turret roof..
