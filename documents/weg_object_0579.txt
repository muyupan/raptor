This document describes the Raad-2M Iranian 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

In early September 1997 it was reported that Iran had successfully tested a locally built rapid fire mobile field gun known as Raad-2 (Thunder-2). 
It uses a turret that has a similar layout to the M109A1, 155mm/39-cal self-propelled howitzer.  The Iranian Defense Industries Organization claimed that the 155 mm HM44 howitzer manufactured by the Hadid facility of the Iranian Defense Industries Organization had a high firing rate and accuracy. It was described as being able to fire five rounds per minute. The gun's range was reported as 30km (19mi), and it also includes features such as a laser range-finder and a semi-automatic loading system. The gun looks exactly like 155mm/39-cal M185 gun from M109A1 and is fitted with a double baffle muzzle brake, fume extractor, screw breech mechanism, hydro-pneumatic recuperator and a hydraulic recoil brake. It uses the Iranian-made Boragh APC chassis, a conversion of the either the Russian BMP-1 or Chinese Type 86 (WZ-501) IFV. It was described as being able to move with a speed of 70km/h (43mph) on the battlefield.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of).
