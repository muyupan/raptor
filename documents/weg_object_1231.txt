NTC VISMOD Andromeda-D Russian Automated Command and Control (C2) System
The Andromeda-D ACS is a complex of automatic devices for equipping stationary and mobile troop command posts.

The Andromeda-D is an automatic control system developed by Sozvezdie to meet the Russian Armed Force's requirement for network-centric operations in real-time. The Andromeda-D will make possible cooperation between ground and airborne forces installed on Armata, Kurganets, and Boomerang armored vehicle families. The system provides real-time information about the technical and tactical status of a given armored vehicle including speed, route, fuel, and ammo reserves. The first stage of development of the new system will be completed by the end of 2017 with it going operational in 2018 or later. Andromeda-D affects the communications hardware supplied to the armored vehicles and above all software which is the key component of the new system. Actually, Andromeda-D was already being used by the Russian Airborne units within 2016.
