This document describes the Kh-101 / Kh-102 Russian Air Launched Cruise Missile.

The Kh-101 / Kh-102 Raduga is a new line of conventional and nuclear-capable air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) developed and deployed by Russia.  A stealthy missile, the Kh-101 / Kh-102 is designed to defeat air defense systems by flying low and hugging the terrain to avoid their radar systems.  The Kh-101 is the conventional warhead version while the Kh-102 is the nuclear-capable version of the Raduga.
The missile also has radar-absorbing capabilities which make it difficult to detect.  It boasts a radar cross-section of .01 square meters.
The missile has no booster engine and therefore, relied on the altitude of its launch aircraft to assist it in reaching attack speed.  The altitude window is 3,000m to 12,000m flying at a speed of 900km/h.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
