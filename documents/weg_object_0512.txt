This document describes the 9P140 (BM-27 Uragan) Russian 220mm Multiple Rocket Launch (MRL).

Hezbollah Proliferation. The 9P140 (BM-27 Uragan) Russian 220mm Multiple Rocket Launch (MRL) began its service with the Soviet Army in the late 1970s and was its first modern spin and fin stabilized heavy multiple rocket launcher. The BM-27 Uragan is capable of launching 220mm rockets from 16 launch tubes mounted on the rear of a ZIL-135 8x8 chassis. This vehicle is extremely similar to that used in the FROG-7 free flight rocket system. It has two gasoline engines that power its 20 tons to a maximum speed of 65 kilometers per hour. One engine drives the four wheels on the left of the truck, while the other engine drives the four wheels on the right. The ZIL-135 has an eight-wheel drive, but only the front and rear axles are used for steering. It has a maximum cruising range of 500 kilometers.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Belarus, CFE Treaty, Eritrea, Guinea, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Non-State Actors, Russian Federation, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Yemen.
