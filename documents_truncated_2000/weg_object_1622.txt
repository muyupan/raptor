This document describes the Type 636A Class (Zhu Kezhen Class) Chinese Hydrographic Survey Ship.

TypeType 636A Class (Zhu Kezhen Class) Chinese Hydrographic Survey Ship is the successor of earlier Type 636. Construction of the first ship of Type 636A began at Wuhu Shipyard in May 2003 and there are more than two dozen surveying systems installed onboard. Originally named Ocean 20, but subsequently changed to Zhu Kezhen. The second ship of Type 636A was originally named Ocean 22 but subsequently changed to Qian Sanqiang. The Type 636 and its successor Type 636A hydrographic survey ships are Chinese survey vessels currently in service with the People's Liberation Army Navy and Chinese Coast Guard.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

The Note is The PLAN operates a variety of Haiyang [ = Ocean] Type 636/636A distant-ocean survey ships, analogs of the U.S. Navyâ€™s Pathfinder class hydrographic survey ships. These ships carry out bathymetric surveys and acquire oceanographic and meteorological data, which function inputs for the manufacturing of charts and the improvement and development of forecasting systems.

The marine survey refers back to the research of hydrological, meteorological, physical, chemical, biological, and sedimentary distribution and adjustments in a selected sea area. In the military field, marine surveys also are extraordinarily important, such as the study of ocean acoustics, the exploration of numerous topographical functions at the seabed, and the usage of deep-dive techniques..
