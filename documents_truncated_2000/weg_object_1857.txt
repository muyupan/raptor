Here is Variants information for the Type 56 Chinese 7.62mm Assault Rifle:
The Type 56 is The basic variant was introduced in 1956. A copy of the AK-47 with a fixed wooden stock and permanently attached spike bayonet. In the mid-1960s production switched from machined to stamped receivers, mimicking the improved (and cheaper) Russian AKM, while the permanently attached bayonet became optional. Still used by Chinese reserve and militia units..
The Type 56-I is Copy of the AKS, with an under-folding steel shoulder stock and the bayonet, removed to make the weapon easier to carry. As with the original Type 56, milled receivers were replaced by stamped receivers in the mid-1960s, making the Type 56-1 an equivalent to the Russian AKMS. Civilian semi-auto versions (Type 56S-I) may have the spike bayonet added, though it is worth noting that this is not the original military configuration..
The Type 56-II is Improved variant introduced in 1980, with a side-folding stock and dark orange bakelite furniture. The bakelite on the stock also houses a cleaning kit, which both under folding AKs (all nations) and other side folding AKs lacked instead requiring a separate pouch. It also allows a traditional detachable bayonet, both AK-47 and AKM styles, as an option in addition to the folding spike style. Mainly manufactured for export and rare in China as the Type 81 was already in production by the time of conception..
The RK 56 TP TÄYD is Modified Type 56-II in China for Finnish use, this is just an Type 56-II with a new hammer spring that allows for firing of Finnish 7.62x39..
The Type 56-3 & Type 56-4 is Versions of the Type 56 and Type 56-I with Type 56-II synthetic furniture and optional detachable bayonets..
The Type 56C (QBZ-56C) is Short-barrel version was introduced in 1991 for the domestic and export market. The QBZ-56C as it is officially designated in China is a carbine variant of the Type 56-II and is supplied in limited quantities to some PLA units. The Chinese Navy is now the most prominent user. Development began in 1988 after it was discovered that the Type 81 assault rifle was too difficult to shorten. In order to further reduce weight, the bayonet lug was removed. The QBZ-56C is often carried with a twenty-round box magazine, although it is capable of accepting a standard Type 56 thirty-round magazine. It also has a side folding stock in addition to a muzzle booster, giving it a similar appearance to the AKS-74U..
The Type 56S or Type 56 is also known as the AK47S, AKS-762, and MAK-90 (Model of the AK)-1990 – civilian version with only a semiautomatic model Later versions were modified to meet the requirements of a 1989 Executive Order by President George H. W. Bush prohibiting the importation of certain 'assault rifle' configurations of military-style semi-automatic rifles such as the Norinco AKM/AK-47. These modifications included a one-piece U.S.-made thumbhole stock to replace the separate Chinese-made buttstock and pistol grip of the original AK rifle and the inclusion of a rivet on the receiver preventing the use of standard AK-47, RPK, or AKM magazines..
The 56S Galil sidefolder is A special version of the 56S/MAC-90 with an IMI Galil style side folding stock. Was exclusive to the US market..
The The Legend is Another version of the 56S/MAK-90 except configured to look like the Type 3 AK-47. It is extremely faithful to the Type 3 design, even having a milled receiver and original AK-47 style bayonet lug, but does retain some manufacturing differences from the Type 56 such as the pinned-in barrel, lack of vent cuts on the gas tube heat guard, only 3 rivets on the trigger guard, the stamped recoil guide rod, spring-loaded firing pin and variance in machining such as on the receiver and lightening cuts. Like the previous, US market only..
The Type 56M or Type 56-5 is RPK style LMG version of the Type 56. Utilizes a standard Type 56 stamped receiver and front trunnion, likely due to their rigidity, and its bi-pod is more RPD like then RPK, being tubular. It seems to have two configurations with only minor cosmetic changes, one with standard AK-47/M open sights with "ears" and the bi-pod directly behind the front sight base, and a second configuration with typical Type 56 enclosed "hooded" sights and the bi-pod in front of the front sight base near the muzzle. The latter version usually is seen with a birdcage flash hider or AK-74 style muzzle brake. Like the Type 56-II, it was only made for export as the Type 81 LMG was selected for military service instead. Civilian semi-auto sporter versions are known as the Type 87S (Type 86S-7) or NHM 91. The semi-auto versions have also been sold with standard Type 56 stocks instead of the RPD "club foot" style as well as thumbhole variants after 1989. A rare version known as the "National Match" was once sold with a milled receiver and scope and scope mount..
The Type 84 is An export version of the Type 56 rifle chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO round. Also has underfolder (Type 84-1) and sidefolder (Type 84-2) versions. Civilian semi-auto version known as Type 84S and AKS-223. Special matte black synthetic versions were also available as the Type 84-3, Type 84-4 (underfolder) and Type 84-5 (sidefolder)..
The Type 86S is Bullpup version..
The KL-7.62 is An unlicensed, reverse-engineered Iranian copy of the Type 56. The original version of the KL-7.62 was indistinguishable from the Type 56, but in recent years DIO appears to have made some improvements to the Type 56 design, adding a plastic stock and handguards (rather than wood) and a ribbed receiver cover (featured on most AKM variants, but missing from the Type 56), as well as picatinny rails on newer versions..
The MAZ is Sudanese licensed copy of the Type 56 made by Military Industry Corporation..
The ASh78 (Automatiku Shqiptar 78) is Albanian licensed copy of the Type 56.
The TUL-1 is North Vietnamese-made variant, but with stock of an RPK, barrel sights from an RPD. The TUL-1's body was thin, only 1 mm compared to the 1.5 mm of an RPK. It was also heavier and had an inferior rate of fire compared to the RPK. However, the firing rate and effective range of the weapon was better than an AK-47-based rifle. The TUL-1ss were manufactured between 1970–1974 and ended after Vietnam obtained production rights to the RPK itself. They're known to use 30-round magazines from AK-47-based rifles with the occasional 40-round magazine..
