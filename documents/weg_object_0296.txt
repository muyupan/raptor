This document describes the Evo II American Remote Controlled Quadcopter.

Experience the current leading edge of video resolution with the EVO II 8K Drone from Autel. With an 8K camera payload, the EVO II 8K can capture video at up to 7680 x 4320 resolution (8000 x 6000 stills). This lets you make prints up to 100" wide, punch in, crop, and scale images with great detail, and capture stunning hi-res screenshots from your footage.

The EVO II drone provides hi-end specifications and abilities well beyond videography and photography. The 7100mAh battery lets it fly for up to 40 minutes at a time, the motors can fly in Ludicrous Speed mode at up to 44.8 mph, and you can transmit HD footage back to the controller's 3.3" OLED screen from up to 5.6 miles away. While flying and tracking, 12-sensor omnidirectional obstacle avoidance is coupled with a dual-core processor and AI machine learning to let the EVO II navigate itself around the environment safely, while still getting the shot.
