This document describes the RKhM-4-01 Russian 8x8 Amphibious CBRN Reconnaissance Vehicle.

The RKhM-4 is designed for radiation and chemical agent reconnaissance day and night, under adverse meteorological conditions, in rough terrain when negotiating natural and artificial ground or water obstacles. The vehicle design is based on the BTR-80 APC. The RKhM-4-01 vehicle: carries out field radiation level metering conducts radioactivity testing of objects and samples; detects radiation (outside vehicle); carries out automatic atmosphere testing for contaminants; conducts periodic tests for air contamination and contamination of objects and samples; conducts sampling for radioactivity tests and contaminating substance tests; flags contaminated areas; advises of contamination in the area of patrolling; conducts terrain orientation in adverse terrain and weather conditions, day and night; conducts weather observations.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Russian Federation.
