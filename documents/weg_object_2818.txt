This document describes the AN/PRC-117G American Multiband Manpack Radio.

The AN/PRC-117 Multiband Manpack Radio, or Multiband Multi Mission Radio (MBMMR), is a man-portable, tactical software-defined combat-net radio, manufactured by Harris Corporation, in two different version:

Version F (Foxtrot), namely AN/PRC-117F-MP Falcon II series, covering the 30-512 MHz frequency range, provided without internal GPS (optionally an external commercial GPS can be connected, or a GPS SAASM as a Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver [PLGR] or a Defense Advanced GPS Receiver [DAGR]);
Version G (Golf), namely AN/PRC-117G-MP Falcon III series, covering the 30-2000 MHz frequency range, and provided with internal SAASM GPS (optionally an external commercial GPS can be connected).
Both radios have NSA certification for the transmission of voice and data traffic up to the Top Secret level.

The designation AN/PRC translates to "Army Navy / Portable Radio Communications" used for two way Communications, according to Joint Electronics Type Designation System guidelines. The radios are also provided in a vehicular configuration under the AN/VRC-103 nomenclature.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America.
