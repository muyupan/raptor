This document describes the Oste Class (Type 423 Class) German Intelligence Collection Ship.

The Oste class intelligence collection ships are officially designated as fleet service ships. This class is also referred as the Type 423. Three ships of the class were built and are currently in service with the German Navy. These are Oste, Oker and Alster. The lead ship was commissioned in 1988. They replaced the precious Type 422 class. Vessels received the same name and pennant numbers as the three Type 422 class ships they replaced. Currently all Oste class ships are assigned to the 1st submarine squadron.

   The Oste class are purpose-built reconnaissance and intelligence collection ships. Primary function of these vessels is strategic intelligence gathering. These were originally intended to gather data on the Soviet warships. Vessels are fitted with a wide array of electromagnetic, hydroacoustic and electro-optic sensors. Ships of this class can be also used as advanced warning units. These electronic surveillance ships carry no armament.

   Crew of the ship includes 36 sailors and up to 40 intelligence technicians. Accommodation for the crew was designed to civil standard, so the Oste class ships offer more comfort for the crew than other German warships.

   Ships are powered by two Humboldt-Deutz diesel engines, developing 4 400 hp each and delivering power to two shafts. Vessels have a range of 5 000 nautical miles (more than 9 000 km).

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Germany.
