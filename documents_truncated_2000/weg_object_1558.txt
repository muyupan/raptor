This document describes the Ondatra-Class (Project 1176 Class) Russian Landing Craft.

Ondatra Class (Project 1176 Class) Russian Landing Craft is a class of landing craft built for the Soviet Navy and Russian Navy between 1971 and 2009.

The vessels were built by the Azovskiy Shipyard, Rybinsk Shipyard, and Vladivostok Shipyard. Over 30 vessels of this type were built for service with the Soviet and Russian navies, and additional vessels were built for export. The vessels are designated as type DKA Desantanyy Kater and are similar in type to the US Navy Landing Craft Mechanized.

The Ondatra landing craft with an open dry cargo hold and a bow ramp has a limited range and has a shallow draught that makes them ideal for amphibious operations and littoral combat. The Ivan Rogov-class landing ship carries one Ondatra for use as a tug for its Lebed-class air-cushioned landing craft.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Georgia, Russian Federation, Ukraine.
