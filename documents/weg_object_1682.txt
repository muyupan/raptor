This document describes the QBU-88 Chinese 5.8mm Sniper Rifle.

The QBU-88 sniper rifle is a Chinese bullpup designated marksman rifle developed by Norinco for the People's Liberation Army.

The QBU-88 rifle is a gas-operated semi-automatic rifle. It utilizes a short-stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and a three-lug rotating bolt. The action is mounted in the compact steel receiver and enclosed into a polymer bullpup-type housing. To increase accuracy, the action is mated to a 640 mm (25.1 in) long, hammer-forged match-grade barrel. The safety switch is located at the bottom of the receiver, just behind the magazine opening. The QBU-88 rifle is equipped with open, diopter-type adjustable sights, mounted on folding posts. It also has a short proprietary dovetail rail on the receiver which can accept telescope or night sight mounts.

The rifle is intended to be utilized primarily with optics. The standard day optic used on the QBU-88 for military use is a Chinese 3-9×40 scope with an integral quick-release mount. In 2008 a new Chinese 6-24×44 tactical scopes became available for counter-terrorism and other law enforcement use.

The riflings for the QBU-88 differ from the standard QBZ-95 assault rifle. While the QBZ-95 has a 244 mm (9.6 in) twist to stabilize the standard 64-grain DBP-87 ball round, the QBU-88 has a faster 206 mm (8.1 in) twist to stabilize the 70-grain Heavy Ball round and dedicated Sniper load, similar to the QJY-88 general-purpose machine gun, which has progressive rifling with a final twist rate of 206 mm. A long birdcage flash suppressor is fitted to reduce the muzzle signature. A quick-detachable bipod is clamped to the barrel when required.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
