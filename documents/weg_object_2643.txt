This document describes the Pandur I-AM Austrian 6x6 Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The Pandur I is an APC developed and produced by the Austrian company Steyr-Daimler-Puch Spezialfahrzeuge (SSF). It was developed during the 1980s as a private venture, based on the Pegaso BMR-600 design. In 2003, General Dynamics took over Steyr-Daimler-Puch which is now part of General Dynamics European Land Systems (GD ELS), which is also the parent company of MOWAG, Santa Bárbara Sistemas and GD ELS – Germany.
