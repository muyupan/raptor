This document describes the 1L219 Zoopark-1 Russian Mobile Counter-Battery Radar.

The Zoopark-1 missile and artillery round reconnaissance radar system, referred to in the West as a counter-battery radar, was developed by the former Soviet Union in the 1980s as the replacement for the APK-1 Ris radar system. The Zoopark-1 is mounted on an MTLB tracked chassis. It has been designed to automatically determine the coordinates of enemy artillery positions such as mortars, howitzers, rocket launchers, and tactical missile systems. The Zoopark-1 radar system can also serve to monitor the firing results of its own artillery systems. The Zoopark-1 radar system was deployed to Syria in early 2016.

The Zoopark-1 intelligence radar system is completely autonomous and needs five minutes to get set up. The radar can track artillery shells of 82 to 120mm (typically mortar ammunition) at distances of up to 17 kilometers. It can detect 105 to 155mm projectiles at distances of 12 kilometers, multiple launch rocket systems at distances of 22 kilometers, and tactical missiles at ranges of up to 45 kilometers. The radar can track up to 12 targets simultaneously detecting up to 70 firing positions in a minute.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Russian Federation.
