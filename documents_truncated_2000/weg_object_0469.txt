This document describes the PHL-16 (AR3) Chinese 370mm Multiple Rocket Launcher System.

The PHL-16 (AR3) Chinese 370mm Multiple Rocket Launcher System can operate in battery, battalion, or autonomously. A typical battery includes launcher vehicles, reloading vehicles, command post vehicles, meteorological survey vehicles, and other associated support vehicles. The mobility platform used in the AR3 is the same as the AR2/AR1A. However, the armament systems can either be an eight-round (4 × 2 pods) that can fire 370 mm rockets or 10-round (5 × 2 pods) that can fire the same 300 mm rockets fired by the AR1, AR1A, and AR2. Both the 300 mm and the 370 mm launcher tubes are arranged in two pods. The rockets in the firing platform are replaced as pods and not individually.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
