This document describes the Buyan-M Class (Project 21631 Class) Russian Corvette.

Buyan-M Class (Project 21631 Class) Russian Corvette are armed with Kalibr missiles will be able to lay minefields and block navigation, the Izvestia daily writes.

The corvettes were upgraded to engage robotic mines, Defense Ministry sources said. They held the first drills with new munitions. The corvettes were initially designed to defend the coast. However, the launches of Kalibr missiles from the Caspian and Mediterranean Seas at Syrian targets demonstrated their capability to strike to a distance of 1500 km.

On 25 October 2016, Zelenyy Dol and Serpukhov were deployed to the Baltic Sea to join a newly formed division in Kaliningrad.

On 4 November 2014, during the Euronaval-2014 exhibition, it was announced Kazakhstan has sent a request for the construction of three Project 21632 Tornado small artillery/missile ships. The ships were believed to be laid down in 2015.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
