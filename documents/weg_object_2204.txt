This document describes the Type 84 (AT) Chinese Anti-Tank Mine.

The Type 84 (AT) is a Chinese air-dispersed scatterable anti-tank mine, normally deployed by a rocket.  The rockets are launched from a BM-21 Grad or similar multiple rocket launcher systems that can hold up to 24 of the rockets.  A time fuse on the rocket is set before launch, which activates at a predetermined distance after firing. Upon activation, the rocket head bursts, ejecting the mines, which descend with small green parachutes that slow their fall. The mine consists of a cylindrical body with three-prong legs that form a spike, which pierces the ground and arms the mine. If the mine strikes the soft ground, the spike is driven into the ground and the mine is held upright.

Three variants of the mine exist one with a magnetic fuse that detonates upon magnetic influence, one with a self-extending tilt rod fuse, and another with a contact baffle. In addition, the magnetic fuse mine has an anti-handling device.

The mine's penetrator warhead uses the Misznay-Schardin effect to project an explosively formed penetrator to penetrate up to 110 millimeters of rolled homogeneous armor. The mines also have a self-destruct function which can be set to between 4 and 72 hours and will disarm itself after 72 hours.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Libya, Syria.
