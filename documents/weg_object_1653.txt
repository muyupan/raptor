This document describes the Krivak III-Class (Project 11351 Nerey Class) Russian Frigate.

Krivak III Class (Project 11351 Nerey Class) lacked the SS-N-14 missile system, which was replaced by a helicopter and hangar, and only one 100 mm gun at the bow of the ship. All ships were built in Kerch and were intended for the Soviet Border Troops under the KGB. Nowadays, 2 ships remain in service with the Russian FSB Coast Guard and 1 ship is in service with the Ukrainian Navy. It is believed that a single incompleted Krivak III hull (Hetman Bayda Vyshnevetsky c. 1995) from Ukraine was transferred to Russia and then to the Korean People's Navy. NATO referred to these ships as Krivak III-class.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation, Ukraine.
