This document describes the J/MPQ-P7 Japanese Towed Artillery Locating Radar.

The Japanese J/MPQ-P7 artillery locating radar developed in Japan for use by he Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force. The radar system is based on the phased-array radar technology. Operating in the X-band, the radar can possibly detect the trajectory of enemy mortar rounds, howitzer projectiles, and rockets. The radar was commissioned in 1976 and shows some characteristics of the U.S.AN/TPQ 36 Firefinder radar. 

The J/MPQ-P7 phased array radar is mounted on a 4 wheel trailer and towed by a track prime mover/operations vehicle. The system is powered by a generator. The antenna produces a high peak power of 250kW and has an accuracy of of 100m; 0.17 degrees.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Japan.
