This document describes the EIMOS Spanish 60mm / 81mm Self-Propelled Integrated Mortar.

The EXPAL Integrated Mortar System (EIMOS) is a self-propelled system capable of carrying either 60-mm or 81-mm mortars. It is designed to provide close fire support for all types of operations. The system's mobility and rapid-response capabilities are particularly suited for asymmetric conflicts.

The concept demonstrator features an autonomous soft-recoil mortar system installed on a turntable mount on the back of a Urovesa VAMTAC 4 x 4 high-mobility utility vehicle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bahrain, Italy, Spain.
