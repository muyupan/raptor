This document describes the MiG-23 (Flogger) Russian Fighter Aircraft.

The 'swing-wing' MiG-23 (NATO reporting name: Flogger) was developed in the 1960s in response to the US F-14 Tomcat. It succeeded the previous MiG-21. It combined greater payload, range and firepower with beyond visual range intercept capability from more powerful onboard sensors. The Model 23-11 prototype first flew in 1967. Production commenced in 1969.The MiG-23's predecessor, the MiG-21, was fast and agile, but limited in its operational capabilities by its primitive radar, short range, and limited weapons load (restricted in some aircraft to a pair of short-range R-3/K-13 (AA-2 "Atoll") air-to-air missiles). Work began on a replacement for the MiG-21 in the early 1960s. The new aircraft was required to have better performance and range than the MiG-21, while carrying more capable avionics and weapons including beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles. A major design consideration was take-off and landing performance. The VVS demanded the new aircraft have a much shorter take-off run. Low-level speed and handling was also to be improved over the MiG-21. Maneuverability was not an urgent requirement. This led Mikoyan to consider two options: lift jets, to provide an additional lift component, and variable-geometry wings, which had been developed by TsAGI for both "clean-sheet" aircraft designs and adaptations of existing designs.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Angola, Cuba, Ethiopia, India, Kazakhstan, Libya, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine.

Here is Variants information for the MiG-23 (Flogger) Russian Fighter Aircraft:
The MiG-23S "Flogger-A" is The "Flogger-A" was the initial production variant. An interim variant, it was externally similar to the prototype but as the Sapfir-23 had been delayed it was equipped with the RP-22SM Sapfir radar and lacked an IRST. The first MiG-23Ss were powered by an R-27F-300 turbojet with a dry thrust of 67.62 kN (15,200 lbf) and 78.5 kN (17,600 lbf) on afterburner; later version used the uprated R-27F2M-300 with a dry thrust of 64.53 kN (14,510 lbf) and 98 kN (22,000 lbf) on afterburner..
The MiG-23M "Flogger-B" is The "Flogger-B" was the most produced variant of the first-generation 'Floggers,' the MiG-23M first flew in June 1972 and became the VVS' chief air superiority fighter, giving it a true look-down/shoot-down capability. While the first fighters were equipped with the Sapfir-23L, it was quickly succeeded by the improved Sapfir-23D (and in 1975 the Sapfir-23D-III), allowing the MiG-23M to carry a pair of R-23 missiles and R-60 missiles. Other updates to the electronics included the SAU-23A three-axis automatic flight control system/autopilot and Polyot-11-23 navigation system. An updated wing design, the definitive Edition 3 wing, retained the Edition 2's design but added leading-edge slats back to improve handling characteristics. The variant was powered by an uprated R-27 turbojet, the Tumansky R-29-300 (izdeliye 55a), which had a dry thrust of 81.35 kN (18,290 lbf) and 122.5 kN (27,500 lbf) with afterburners. Plumbed pylons were also introduced to allow the MiG-23M to carry 800-litre drop tanks when the wings were at full spread..
The MiG-23U "Flogger-C" is The "Flogger-C" was a twin-seat training variant based on the MiG-23S, first appearing six months after the single-seater's introduction. Its only major design difference was the addition of a second cockpit where the equipment bay was located, necessitating its movement into the redesigned nose. It retained the MiG-23S' GSh-23L gun with 200 rounds and could carry up to 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) of bombs. Equipped with the S-21 weapon control system centered on the Sapfir-21M radar, the MiG-23U could fire the R-3S and R-13M missiles. Also like the MiG-23 Edition 1971 and MiG-23M, a fourth fuel tank was added with a capacity of 470 liters. Production of the MiG-23U began at Irkutsk in 1971 and eventually converted to the MiG-23UB..
The MiG-23BM "Flogger-D" is The "Flogger-D" is considered an experimental variant and is upgraded with a digital computer and several experimental features, such as it's dielectric heads being moved from the pylons to directly on the wing roots. This aircraft is thought to be the predecessor to the MiG-27, a MiG-23 variant designed to execute air-to-ground / Close Air Support (CAS) missions in addition to the typical air-to-air fighter interceptor role..
The MiG-23MS "Flogger-E" is The "Flogger-E" was another export variant, and was a downgraded version of the MiG-23M. This variant was designed for to exclude advanced capabilities so as to maintain secrecy. While utilizing the same airframe and engine as the MiG-23M, the MiG-23MS was equipped with the same weapons and equipment as the MiG-21S/SM. A downgraded export version of the RP-22SM radar gave the MiG-23MS its distinctively short nose radome, while the undernose IRST was removed. The only missiles it was capable of firing were up to four R-3S and R-3R air-to-air missiles, though the improved R-13M was added later..
The MIG-23B "Flogger-F" is The "Flogger-F" was created to meet the need for a new fighter-bomber, the MiG-23B was similar to the MiG-23S but with a redesigned forward fuselage and a dielectric head just above the pylon. In the flat-bottomed, tapered-down nose was a PrNK Sokol-23 ground attack sight system in place of the radar. The system included an analog computer, a laser rangefinder and a PBK-3 bomb sight. The navigation suite and autopilot were updated to provide more accurate bombing, while the pylons were strengthened to increase the maximum bomb payload to 3,000 kg. To improve the fighter's survivability, the Flogger-F was fitted with an electronic warfare (EW) suite, and an inert gas system was placed in the fuel tanks to prevent fires. The pilot's survivability and visibility was also enhanced by raising their seat and armoring the cockpit windscreen. Instead of the R-29 engine, the MiG-23B was fitted with the Lyulka AL-21 turbojet..
The MiG-23MLA "Flogger G" is The "Flogger-G" first flew in 1977, with mass production beginning in 1978 and sales to foreign customers starting in 1981. Externally, the "MLA" had an improved Sapfir-23MLA (N003) radar with better range, reliability and ECM resistance, and a frequency spacing feature which made co-operative group search operations possible as the radars would now not jam each other. It also had a new ASP-17ML HUD/gunsight, and starting in 1981 added the capability to fire improved Vympel R-24R/T missiles. A new 26ShI IRST was included, which had a maximum detection range of 15 km (9.3 mi) for a high-altitude fighter-sized target operating at full power, or 45 km (28 mi) for a bomber-sized target. However, its field of scanning was restricted compared to the radar: only 60° in azimuth and 15° in elevation..
The MiG-23BK/BN "Flogger-H" is The "Flogger-H" BK export was variant reserved for sales exclusively to former Warsaw Pact countries. In addition to the PrNK-23 system, additional radar warning receivers were mounted on the intakes. The BN variant was more widely exported and was fitted with the Edition 3 wings and R-29 engine of contemporary fighter variants, along with minor updates in electronics and equipment. The other major difference was the removal of the dielectric head found on the MiG-23B. Produced from 1973 to 1985, a total of 624 MiG-23BNs were built, although only a small number served in VVS units with the rest exported. This downgraded version intended for extended worldwide customers proved to be fairly popular and effective. The last MiG-23BN in Indian service flew on 6 March 2009..
