This document describes the Type 212 Class (Todaro Class) German Diesel-Electric Submarine.

The German Type 212 class, also Italian Todaro class, is a non-nuclear submarine developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG (HDW) for the German and Italian navies. It features diesel propulsion and an additional air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using Siemens proton exchange membrane (PEM) compressed hydrogen fuel cells. The submarines can operate at high speed on diesel power or switch to the AIP system for silent slow cruising, staying submerged for up to three weeks with little exhaust heat. The system is also said to be vibration-free, extremely quiet and virtually undetectable.
 
Type 212 is the first fuel cell propulsion system equipped submarine series.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Germany, Italy.
