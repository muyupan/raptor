This document describes the PTZ-89 (Type 89) Chinese 120mm Tank Destroyer.

The PTZ-89 (Type 89) Chinese 120mm Tank Destroyer was a Chinese armored vehicle developed by Norinco for the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army. The vehicle is developed in the 1980s and entered service in 1988.
Armed with a 120mm smooth-bore gun, it was intended to combat newer generations of Western and Russian main battle tanks that were equipped with composite armor and 120 and 125mm caliber guns. Despite a successful development process, with the end of the Cold War, it became apparent that the weapon was no longer needed. Production was halted in 1995 after around 100 examples had been built.[3] It had several shortcomings, including thin armor, high maintenance costs, and an unstabilized gun that could not fire on the move and had a relatively short range. It was phased out in favor of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). An official retirement ceremony was held by the 39th Army Group on 3 November 2015
