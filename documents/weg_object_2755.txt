This document describes the KMT-7 Russian Tank Mounted Mechanical Mine Clearing Device.

The KMT-7 roller is similar to the earlier KMT-5 but utilizes a box channel frame and the rollers are less 'cleated'. The ploughs used with the KMT-7 are similar to those used with the earlier KMT-6. The supporting frames for the rollers are L-shaped to allow the rollers to swing past the frame when a mine is detonated. Chains are fitted between the rollers to detonate tilt-mast fuses. As with previous models, the rollers are carried on a separate vehicle and are fitted using a crane; installation takes up to 3.5 hours. Emergency detachment takes one minute. The KMT-7 clears 800 mm wide tracks with an intermediate space 2.16 m wide. Mine clearing speed is up to 12 km/h, and dependent on ground conditions and mine density. Fitted to an MBT the width of the KMT-7 is 3.95 m; length is 3.45 m. Weight complete with spares, tools and accessories is 7,500 kg.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Egypt, Poland, Russian Federation, Syria.
