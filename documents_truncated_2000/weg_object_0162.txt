This document describes the 9S18M1 Snow Drift Russian Mobile 3D Coherent-Pulse Target Acquisition Radar.

The 9S18M1 radar (NATO name: SNOW DRIFT) is a 3-D acquisition radar operating in the centimetric
Band. The 9S18M1 SNOW DRIFT is a mobile 3-D radar that uses an electronically steered pencil beam. The
system incorporates frequency agility, giving it enhanced resistance to ECM. The SNOW DRIFT generally receives
early warning from brigade-level surveillance radars such as the SPOON REST before acquiring the target. The radar
can track up to 50 targets at a time, and provide target designation on six targets. Weapon systems associated with the
9S18M1 SNOW DRIFT include the SA-11 GADFLY and the SA-17 GRIZZLY.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, Georgia, Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine.
