This document describes the Type 724 Class (Jingash II Class) Chinese Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).

The Type 724 Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC) is the first indigenous air cushion landing craft in operational use with People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), and it origin dates all the way back in the early 1960s, when 7th Academy was assigned to lead the developmental work on air cushioned vehicles for a 10-year plan lasting from 1963 to 1972. Two projects developed from this research work, and Type 724 LCAC is the direct descendant of these two research projects.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the Type 724 Class (Jingash II Class) Chinese Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC):
The Songling LCAC is One of the two direct predecessors of Type 724 LCAC is the Songling (松陵) LCAC built by Songling (松陵) Machinery Factory in Shenyang. From 1963 to 1967, a total of 3 units were built, Songling # 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Named after the factory where they were built, these LCAC are powered by aircraft piston engines with propellers. Although in Chinese military service, they mainly served as trial units to test out the feasibility of deploying air cushioned vehicles, instead of being used operationally as part of the amphibious forces..
The Type 711 LCAC is At the same time Songling LCAC were built, 708th Research Institute in Shanghai also developed another LCAC in parallel. Type 711 is also consisted of three units, numbered 711-1, 711-2 and 711-3 respectively. Type 711 utilizes centralized control which only required a single operator, and it also utilizes variable-pitch propeller. As with Songling LCAC, Type 711 LCAC also mainly served as experimental boats in Chinese navy..
