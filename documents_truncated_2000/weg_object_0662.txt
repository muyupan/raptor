This document describes the Kh-29 (AS-14 Kedge) Russian Air-to-Surface Missile.

The Kh-29 (Russian: Х-29; NATO: AS-14 'Kedge'; GRAU: 9M721) is a Soviet air-to-surface missile with a range of 10–30 km. It has a large warhead of 320 kg, has a choice of laser, infrared, active radar or TV guidance, and is typically carried by tactical aircraft such as the Su-24, Su-30, MiG-29K as well as the "T/TM" models of the Su-25, giving that craft an expanded standoff capability.

The Kh-29 is intended for primary use against larger battlefield targets and infrastructure such as industrial buildings, depots and bridges, but can also be used against ships up to 10,000 tones, hardened aircraft shelters and concrete runways.

The basic aerodynamic layout of the Kh-29 is similar to the Molniya R-60 (AA-8 'Aphid'), reflecting Molniya's heritage in air-to-air missiles. The laser guidance head came from the Kh-25 (AS-10 'Karen') and the TV guidance from the Kh-59 (AS-13 'Kingbolt'), mated to a large warhead.

It has been compared to the United States' AGM-65 Maverick, but the AGM-65 is a much smaller missile than the Kh-29, and weighs less than half as much.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Libya, Malaysia, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Peru, Poland, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Yemen.
