This document describes the 9K720 Iskander (SS-26 Stone) Russian Short-Range Ballistic Missile.

The Iskander (Western reporting name SS-26 Stone) short-range ballistic missile is a successor to the Oka (SS-23 Spider), which was eliminated under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. It was first launched in 1996 and was initially designated by the West as the SS-X-26. At the time of its introduction, it was considered the most advanced missile of its kind. The Iskander-M missile system was officially adopted by the Russian Army in 2006. This system can use different types of missiles.  In 2013 it was reported that 5 types of missiles were already developed for Iskander, and 3 more missiles were still being developed. As of 2017 Russian Army reportedly operates 112 of these missile systems. At least one launcher was deployed in Syria. In 2016 Iskander-E ballistic missiles were delivered to Armenia. Some countries, including China and South Korea, introduced their own clones of the Iskander. Ukraine is currently developing an equivalent system.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Armenia, Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the 9K720 Iskander (SS-26 Stone) Russian Short-Range Ballistic Missile:
The Note is Early TEL variant (SPU 9P78) has one missile.  The TELs can launch launch R-500 cruise missiles..
The Iskander-M is Domestic TEL and missile with 400+km range. Variant for the Russian Armed Forces with two 9M723 quasi ballistic missiles with a published range of 415 km, rumored 500 km. Speed Mach 6–7, flight altitude up to 6–50 km, nuclear-capable stealth missile, controlled at all stages, not ballistic flight path. Immediately after the launch and upon approach to the target, the missile performs intensive maneuvering to evade anti-ballistic missiles. The missile constantly maneuvers during flight as well..
The Iskander-K is Cruise missile only TEL with launcher assembly adapted to mount 6 each R-500 cruise missiles. "K" for Krylataya ("Winged"). Variant intended to carry various types of cruise missiles. At present, it includes:

9M728 (SSC-X-7) also known as R-500 – flight altitude up to 6 km, published range up to 500 km although it may be higher and automatic adjustment in the way, follow of terrain relief in flight. The missile is evolved from 3M10, 3M54/3M14, and Kh-101/102 missiles and can be launched also by the Iskander-M.
9M729 (SSC-X-8) – a new long-range missile that is reportedly a land-based version of the 3M14 Caliber-NK missile complex with a range between 300–3,400 miles (480–5,470 km) and may be based even on the air-launched Kh-101 cruise missile with a range over 5,500 kilometers (3,400 mi). According to RF, its range is only 480 km and its specially-developed self-propelled launcher can carry 4 missiles. The 9M729 missile has a higher yield warhead and a new control system for greater accuracy. Most parts and components of the 9M728 and 9M729 missiles are identical.
Currently, there are 7 different types of ballistic and cruise missiles for both variants of the Iskander missile system..
The Iskander-E is Export variant TEL with a shorter range (280km).  This missile was developed to comply with the missile technology control regime which is no longer in effect. Iskander-E
"E" for Eksport. The director of the state corporation Rostec Sergey Chemezov said – the missile complex Iskander is a serious offensive weapon capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. This ballistic missile system is on the military list of products prohibited for export. Iskander missile complexes cannot be exported.

In 2016, Armenia, a Russian ally and a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) became the first foreign country to operate the system. Iskander-E has a maximum range of up to 280 km, to comply with Missile Technology Control Regime restrictions for export, and is fitted with a simplified inertial guidance system. It flies on a flattened trajectory under 50 km altitude, allowing aerodynamic steering using tail fins, permitting a less predictable flight path and accurate delivery. The system can also use missiles carrying warheads with cluster munitions..
