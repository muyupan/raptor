This document describes the BMD-4 Russian Airborne Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The BMD-4 (Russian: "Боевая Машина Десанта-4"; Boyevaya Mashina Desanta-4 literally "Combat Vehicle of the Airborne") is an amphibious infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) originating from post-Cold War Russia. Originally designated as the BMD-3M, the chassis of the BMD-4 is the same as that of the BMD-3 because it was developed on the same basis. This armored fighting vehicle is one of the lightest and one of the most heavily armed in its class, possessing a substantial amount of firepower in comparison to its counterparts. The vehicle was designed to transport Russian Airborne Troops (VDV); increasing its mobility, armament, and protection on the battlefield.

Many components of the vehicle, such as the ergonomics and positioning of the passengers, remain relatively unchanged. Primary differences between the BMD-4 and its predecessors lie in its armament. The vehicle is fitted with the Bakhcha-U turret, which consists of: a 100 mm 2A70 low-pressure rifled gun, a 30 mm 2A72 coaxial autocannon, and a 7.62 mm PKT coaxial machine gun. The 2A70 rifled cannon is capable of firing high explosive fragmentation rounds and laser-guided anti-tank missiles. It also features secondary weapons designed to engage and destroy enemy infantry and armored fighting vehicles. The automated fire control system of the vehicle is advanced with new features that simplify the use of the vehicle's armament by the gunner and commander.

The vehicle is designed by the Volgograd tractor factory and the armament was developed by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau unitary enterprise located in Tula. Kurganmashzavod is the official manufacturer of the vehicle. The only operator of the BMD-4 is Russia, where it entered service in late 2004 and has been produced ever since then. In 2008, a modernized version, designated as the BMD-4M, was introduced with significant contributions from Kurganmashzavod; the designer of the BMP.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the BMD-4 Russian Airborne Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV):
The BMD-4K is The commander variant featuring an additional radio station..
The BMD-4M is A variant with a modular unification with the BMP-3..
The BMD-4M Sinitsa is A variant with further modular unification with the BMP-3 and Sinitsa turret..
The BTR-MDM Rakushka is A armored personnel carrier based on BMD-4M. It can carry 3 crews and 12 troops..
The 2S25 Sprut-SD- is A new order for 2S25 replacement 125 mm tracked self-propelled guns were made in 2013. These tank destroyers are planned to be made using the chassis of the BMD-4 with the turret being replaced by the 2A46M-5 125 mm gun; the same smoothbore gun used on the T-90.
The 2S42 Lotus is A self-propelled 120 mm mortar based on BMD-4M.
The Ptitselov is A self-propelled airdroppable SAM system with twelve 9M337 missiles based on BMD-4M.
The BMD-4M is The BMD-4M was unveiled by Kurganmashzavod in 2008. This vehicle retains the Bakhcha-U turret with a number of other innovations. Overall bulletproof crew protection is ensured. Special lightweight and durable alloys make this possible without the vehicle losing its ability to swim or be airdropped. The more powerful and compact engine of the BMP-3 is integrated into the BMD-4M; providing 500 hp.In general, the unification of units, plants, and systems of the modernized BMD-4 chassis with the same units, plants and systems of BMP-3 is 80%. This decreases the expenses of the airborne assault vehicle servicing in the army allowing a significant reduction of service maintenance of airborne combat vehicles in the army..
The BMD-4M Sinitsa is The BMD-4M Sinitsa was unveiled in 2017. This vehicle has the Sinitsa turret combat module fitted with a top-mounted panoramic sight with a thermal imaging channel and housing a 100 mm 2A70 tank gun/ATGM launcher, 30 mm 2A72 autocannon and a 7.62mm PKMS medium machine gun. The original power unit and transmission system are changed to the parts used in the BMP-3 to standardise production and spare parts supply..
The Kornet-D1 is In January 2019, the Russian MoD announced it would begin state trials of the 9P163 Kornet-D1 anti-tank missile system, a version of the BMD-4M chassis modified to fire Kornet ATGMs..
