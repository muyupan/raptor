This document describes the 9P162 Kornet-T (BMP M1995) Russian Anti-Tank Missile Carrier.

The 9P162 Kornet-T is a new anti-tank missile carrier. It is armed with Kornet anti-tank guided missiles. It is intended to replace the aging Shturm-S (based on the MT-LB tracked armored vehicle) and 9P148 (based on the BRDM-2 armored scout car). First Kornet-T anti-tank missile carriers were delivered in 2003. The first batch of 20 production vehicles was delivered to the Russian Army in 2012.

   The Kornet-T is based on the BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle chassis. It is similar to the Khrizantema, which is also based on the BMP-3 cassis. The Khrizantema entered service with the Russian Army back in 2004. It seems that the Kornet-T will be used by motorized units, while the Khrizantema by artillery units.

   The Kornet-T can engage tanks, fortifications, and low-flying helicopters. This missile carrier can operate and fire in day/night conditions, in adverse weather conditions, and when the enemy uses countermeasures.

   This anti-tank missile carrier is fitted with an automatic loader. A total of 16 missiles are carried by the vehicle. 12 missiles are stored in the autoloader and 4 more are stored inside the hull. This missile carrier has two launchers. Both missiles can be launched against the same target. The vehicle can also engage two targets simultaneously. During traveling both launches are retracted inside the hull. The vehicle has a brief deployment time.

 

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
