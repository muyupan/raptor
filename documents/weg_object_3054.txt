This document describes the M1937 (ML-20) Russian 152mm Towed Howitzer.

The  M1937 (ML-20) Russian 152mm Towed Gun Howitzer is an obsolete 152-mm gun/howitzer almost completely replaced in the Russian ground forces by the D-20 (M1955). The ML-20 uses the same carriage as the A-19 (M1931/M1937) 122-mm Corps Gun but has a shorter barrel with a multi-slotted muzzle brake. The recoil mechanism is mounted below the barrel, which is balanced by twin equilibrators that stand just ahead of the small shield. The riveted, box-section split trail is carried by a two-wheel limber during travel and anchored by detachable recoil spades on each leg during firing. The main carriage wheels are dual-tired discs with narrow treads. The overall length of the gun during travel is reduced by pulling the barrel rearwards over the joined trail legs. The ML-20 fires case-type, separately loaded ammunitions. Principal rounds for the gun are the OF-540 high-explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG), G-530 and G-545 concrete-piercing (CP), and BR-540 armor-piercing with tracer (AP-T) projectiles.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bulgaria, Mongolia, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine.
