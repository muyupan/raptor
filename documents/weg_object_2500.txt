This document describes the EE-9 Cascavel Mark 4 Brazilian 6x6 Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle.

The EE-9 Cascavel (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɐʃ.kɐ.ˈvɛɫ], translated to Rattlesnake) is a six-wheeled Brazilian armoured car developed primarily for reconnaissance. It was engineered by Engesa in 1970 as a replacement for Brazil's ageing fleet of M8 Greyhounds. The vehicle was first fitted with the Greyhound's 37mm main gun, and subsequently, a French turret adopted from the Panhard AML-90. Later models carry unique Engesa turrets with a Belgian 90mm Cockerill Mk.3 cannon produced under licence as the EC-90.

The Cascavel shares many components with the EE-11 Urutu, its armoured personnel carrier counterpart; both entered production in 1974 and are now operated by over 20 nations in South America, Africa, and the Middle East. Rights to the design were also sold to the United States via the FMC Corporation. About 2,767 Cascavels and Urutus were manufactured before Engesa ceased operations in 1993.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chad, Colombia, Congo, Cyprus, Ecuador, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Morocco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Paraguay, Qatar, Suriname, Togo, Tunisia, Uruguay, Zimbabwe.
