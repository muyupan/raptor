This document describes the BRM-1 Russian Amphibious Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV).

The BRM-1 (BMP-R or BMP M1976) is an armored reconnaissance vehicle that is derived from the BMP Fighting Vehicle (BMP M1976/1) without smoke grenade launchers, added comms (R-130, R-014D telegraph), and Tall Mike radar but with four more passengers. The BMP Ml976 reconnaissance vehicle has the same enlarged two-man turret as the M1975 but mounts the standard 73-mm main gun (without the SAGGER launcher). The BMP M 1976(2) model has a small parabolic antenna on the roof. One of these vehicles is assigned, along with three BMP-1s, to the reconnaissance company of a motorized rifle or tank regiment, and three of them are assigned to the reconnaissance battalion of a motorized rifle or tank division.
