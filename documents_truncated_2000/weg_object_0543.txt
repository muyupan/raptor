This document describes the SIG Sauer P320 American 9mm Semi-Automatic Pistol.

The SIG Sauer P320 is a modular semi-automatic pistol made by SIG Sauer, Inc. of Exeter, New Hampshire, and SIG Sauer GmbH of Eckernförde, Germany. It is a further development of the SIG Sauer P250, utilizing a striker-fired mechanism in lieu of a double-action-only hammer system. The P320 can be chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum, .357 SIG, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP, and can be easily converted from one caliber to another—a change from .357 SIG to .40 S&W requires only a barrel change; a change between 9mm to .357 SIG or .40 S&W and vice versa are accomplished using a caliber exchange kit.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Norway, Switzerland, Thailand, United States of America.
