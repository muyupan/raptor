This document describes the AH-1J SeaCobra American Attack Helicopter.

The USMC desired a twin engine AH-1G, based on a desire for improved safety and redundancy for over-water operation, which would become a hallmark of all subsequent USMC AH-1 types. The AH-1J "Sea Cobra" was developed and the USMC ordered this version of the Cobra in May 1968. Featuring the Pratt and Whitney Twinpac T400 engine (two 900-hp turboshaft engines coupled together) giving an overall increase in installed power, the AH-1J Sea Cobra included a new nose turret gun, with the three barrel XM197 20mm cannon, as well as other improvements. While development and production of the first 49 ordered were under way, the Marines obtained 38 AH-1Gs from the Army.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Turkey, United States of America.
