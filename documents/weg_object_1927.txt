This document describes the PF-98 (Type 98) Chinese 120mm Anti-Tank Rocket.

PF-98 (Type 98) Chinese 120mm Anti-Tank Rocket is a 120mm unguided anti-tank rocket system developed by Norinco for the People's Liberation Army as a successor to the Type 65 and Type 78 recoilless guns. It is also known by its nickname, "Queen Bee". The PLA began to search for a successor for the Type 78 in the 1990s. The older, 1950s-era equipment began to show its age. Type 98 was revealed with a garrison unit in Macao in 1999, while some elite units began to receive the weapon after 2000. The design makes the accurate delivery of a 120 mm multi-purpose high-explosive or high-explosive anti-tank projectile with negligible recoil possible. The weapon can be tripod- or shoulder-fired.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, Cameroon, China, Indonesia, Zimbabwe.

Here is Variants information for the PF-98 (Type 98) Chinese 120mm Anti-Tank Rocket:
The PF98 is Battalion and company level version..
The PF98A is Lightweight version for infantry squad..

Here is System information for the PF-98 (Type 98) Chinese 120mm Anti-Tank Rocket:
The Alternative Designation is PF-98; Type 98; Queen Bee.
The Type is Anti-Tank Rocket.
The Manufacturer is Norinco.
The Crew is 1-2.
The Man Portable is Yes.
The Launcher is The reusable tube launcher is fibreglass-wrapped and weighs under 10 kg. Two variants are available; both are equipped with night vision. The reaction time (from acquiring the target to firing) is about 10 seconds. Starting from 1999, the PLA deployed PF98 to both Company and Battalion units for direct and indirect infantry fire support.

The fire-control of the battalion version Type 98 consists of an optical sight with night vision channel (500 m range), a fire-control computer, a laser range-finder and an LED display. The system can automatically find the distance and make the ballistic calculations which are then displayed on the LED screen for the gunner. This reduces the reaction time and makes for increased accuracy.

The company version Type 98 is fitted with an x4 telescopic optical sight with a night vision channel (300 m range). A computer calculates the lead of moving targets and put a light spot in the gunner’s optical sight to assist in aiming the device. The tripod of the battalion version allows an elevation of +30° to −6° around 360°. The weapon is manually operated by 1–2 soldiers. The company version has a small fixed tripod to support the launcher when it is used in lower firing position.

In late 2018, the lightweight PF-98A was deployed for infantry use on a squad level. The launcher's firing tube, tripod and carrying handle are modified to reduce weight significantly..
The Trigger is The pistol‐grip/trigger‐mechanism controls the firing of the weapon using an electrical firing sequence to initiate the loaded round..
The Fixed Pistol Grip is Yes, the pistol grip and firing mechanism are a single unit fixed to the bottom of the launch tube/barrel..
The Shoulder-Fired is Yes, most often a shoulder-fired weapon..
The Bipod / Tripod Configuration is Both a bipod and tripod are available for improved stability and accuracy. In the tripod configuration, additional sighting systems are fitted. Additionally, when fitted to the tripod further controls are added to the firing mechanism, namely a handheld trigger module connected to the launcher by a ruggedized cable allowing the user to operate the weapon without having to awkwardly position themselves to hold on to the pistol grip. The tripod also features elevation and traverse gears to allow for precise laying of the weapon on to the target..
The Elevation is −6° / +30°.
The Traverse is 360°.
The Rate of Fire is 4–6 rounds per minute.
The Muzzle Velocity is 310 m/s.
The Maximum FIring Range, HEAT is 800 m.
The Maximum Firing Range, HEI is 1,800 m.
The Emplacement Time is INA.
The Displacement Time is INA.
The Sights is Y/MK/PF-98(Y)-120 (4x optical/fire control)
Y/MK/PF-98(L)-120 (4x optical).

Here is Dimensions information for the PF-98 (Type 98) Chinese 120mm Anti-Tank Rocket:
The Length is 1,191 mm.
The Width is INA.
The Height is INA.
The Weight, Combat is 10 kg.

Here is Rocket information for the PF-98 (Type 98) Chinese 120mm Anti-Tank Rocket:
The Name is INA.
The Type is HEAT.
The Caliber is 120 mm.
The Warhead is The HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) projectile is armed with a double (tandem) warhead and an electronically timed fuse. The round can pierce the reactive armor of the main battle tank and has an armor-piercing depth of about 800 mm RHA (under 90 degrees) at a maximum range of 800 m..
The Maximum Firing Range is 800 m (HEAT) to 1800 m (HEI)..
The Note is The multipurpose high explosive round has a warhead with 120 steel balls and incendiary material. This round is capable of piercing 400 mm armor (under 55 degrees). Due to the fragmented nature, it kills the crew inside or produces fragments to kill other personnel within 25 m of the point of impact. The maximum range is 1,800–2,000 m..
