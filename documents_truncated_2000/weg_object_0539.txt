This document describes the M110A1 American 203mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The M110A1 American 203mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH), is a variant of the M110 American 203mm Self-Propelled Howitzer. Versions of the M110 with the longer barrel are the M110A1 (no muzzle brake) and the M110A2 (fitted with muzzle brake). In 1977, the first M110A1s entered service; these were armed with the longer 8" howitzer M201. The M201 allowed greater range over the shorter M2A2 howitzer. The M110A1s had been limited to zone 8 of the M188A1 propelling charge, but the muzzle brake alleviated excessive recoil forces and allowed the howitzer to fire zone 9, which permitted greater range.  The M110A1 replaced both the M110 and M107, which were phased out of service with the US Army in Europe by 1980. It then cost less than USD100,000 to convert the M107/M110 to the M110A1/M110A2 standard.
