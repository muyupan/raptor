This document describes the Vapor 55 American All-Electric Helicopter UAS.

The all-electric VAPOR 55 Helicopter UAS delivers flight control performance, endurance, and payload flexibility. Featuring military-grade components, intelligent HW/SW system design, and high energy density lithium-polymer
battery, VAPOR delivers enhanced flight stability and up to one hour of flight time on a single battery charge.
With an expansive modular payload bay, and up to 10 lbs. useable payload capacity, VAPOR is multi-mission capable, with access to a variety of available integrated sensors and third party payloads including EO/IR, survey
grade PPK mapping, LiDAR and hyperspectral sensors, and Drop/Delivery Mechanism. Every VAPOR Helicopter UAS incorporates proprietary HeliSynthâ„¢ technology for system level optimization including advanced autopilot,
payload control & operation, and mission performance efficiency.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.
