This document describes the ASLAV-25 Australian 8x8 Amphibious Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle.

The Australian Light Armoured Vehicle (ASLAV) is an eight-wheeled amphibious armoured reconnaissance vehicle used by the Australian Army. It was built by General Dynamics Land Systems Canada, and developed from the Canadian Army's LAV-25 and Bison armoured fighting vehicles.

The ASLAV is a highly mobile, eight-wheel drive, amphibious armoured fighting vehicle that can be deployed by land, sea or air (in Royal Australian Air Force C-130s or C-17s). It is fitted with GPS, an intra-vehicular navigation system and a radio harness capable of supporting HF, VHF, UHF and digital radios.

The ASLAV is capable of speeds of 100 km/h (62 mph) and has a maximum range in excess of 660 km (410 mi). The eight-wheel drive provides excellent cross-country mobility and redundancy, the vehicle is capable of operation with only four working wheels, and can continue to operate with eight punctured tyres through the use of solid-core run-flat tyres. It is fully amphibious and is driven in the water by permanent shrouded propellers located at the rear of the hull at speeds of up to 10 km/h (6.2 mph)

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Australia.
