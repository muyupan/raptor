The gun is equipped with a semi-automatic loading system that provides a rate of fire from 6 to 8 rounds per minute. The maximum range of standard ammunition is 18 km, for EFRB (Extend Range Full Bore) - up to 22 km and 27 km - for projectiles with Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAP). The vehicle has ammunition total of 40 rounds. The 12.7-mm machine gun is mounted on the roof of the turret, near the commander's hatch. On the sides of the turret, there are also four smoke grenade launchers.
