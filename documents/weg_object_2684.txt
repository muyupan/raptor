This document describes the GZQ-411 Chinese Light Pontoon Bridge.

The Type GZQ411 Light Pontoon Bridge set can be used to assemble a floating bridge, a raft, or an offshore work platform. When used as an offshore work platform, the surface area available is 5.7 m × 10.8 m. An individual bow pontoon unit can be used as an assault or river boat.

The pontoon units are probably of light alloy construction, as are the two tracks of the bridge deck. Loading ramps, central fill panels for the bridge, and handrails are also included. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is believed to have at least two designated light pontoon-type bridges in service. The first of these is designated as the Type 63/GZQ310 Light Ribbon Bridge, which is a local copy of the Russian PPP Light Pontoon Bridge. The Type 63 was followed by the Type GZQ411 Light Pontoon Bridge.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Tanzania, Zimbabwe.
