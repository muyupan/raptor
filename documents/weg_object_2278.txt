This document describes the M14 (Toepopper) American Anti-Personnel Mine.

The M14 mine "Toepopper" is a small (56 mm [2.2 in] diameter) anti-personnel land mine first deployed by the United States circa 1955. The M14 mechanism uses a belleville spring to flip a firing pin downwards into a stab detonator when pressure is applied. Once deployed, the M14 is very difficult to detect because it is a minimum metal mine, i.e. most of its components are plastic. Because of this, the design was later modified to ease mine clearance via the addition of a steel washer, glued onto the base of the mine.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Cambodia, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), South Korea (Republic of Korea), Viet Nam.
