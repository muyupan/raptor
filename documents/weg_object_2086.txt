This document describes the QJG-02 Chinese 14.5mm Heavy Machine Gun.

The QJG02 is a modern light anti-aircraft gun of Chinese origin. It was developed in the late 1990's. In Chinese service this replaces the Soviet ZPU-1 and locally produced variants. Although classified as a light anti-aircraft gun, the practical role is that this weapon provides light infantry with serious firepower against ground targets.

Reportedly the QJG02 is based on the Soviet KPV design, but externally it looks similar to the QJC88 (a.k.a. W85) heavy machine gun. The QJG02 is a belt fed heavy machine gun. The heavy barrel is fluted and features a large double baffle muzzle brake. The QJG02 is thus far seen on a lightweight tripod which allows the QJC02 to be used in a ground and anti-air role.

The QJQ02 fires the 14.5x114mm round which has twice the muzzle energy of 12.7mm rounds used in many heavy machine guns. Various types of ammunition can be used, inlusing recent APDS rounds which are effective against light armored vehicles. The cyclic rate of fire is 500 rpm. Reportedly a downside of the limited weight is that automatic fire results causes the weapon to jump, resulting in reduced accuracy at longer ranges.

The QJG02 is a rather lightweight system compared to the older ZPU-1. The weapon and tripod can be taken apart, enabling 6 men to carry it over longer distances. A model with detachable wheels can be towed by vehicles on roads and is easier to manhandle in the field. The QJG02 has also been mounted on small all-terrain vehicles for airborne troops as a pintle mounted weapon.

The QJG02 is in use with the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army since around 2005, although officially adopted as early as 2002. It is often seen in use with light infantry units that received more modern equipment. The QJG02 is also available for export. The QJG02 has seen combat use in various recent conflicts in the Middle East and Africa.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
