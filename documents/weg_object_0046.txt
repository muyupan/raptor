This document describes the ZTZ-96B (Type 96B) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The ZTZ-96B (Type 96B) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT) is the latest version of the Type 96 Tank and made its first public debut at the 2016 Tank Biathlon. Developed by Norinco, an estimated 5 to 7 had been built and were seen being moved to the event by a freight train. On August 15th, the front left road wheel came off the vehicle whilst in motion at the Biathlon. The Type 96B Tank's main upgrade has been the engine. Reports from varying high-ranked Chinese Officers in the media have always highlighted the need for a bigger engine in the Type 96 Tank and it's believed a new 1200hp diesel engine has been installed.

This would explain the removal of the old twin circular exhausts and housing on the right side of the hull. The rear of the hull has also been modified and appears flat with a circular exhaust on either side of the air vents.

The increase in horsepower will give the Type 96B Tank an increased power-to-weight ratio, improving its acceleration and hill-climbing abilities.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Sudan.
