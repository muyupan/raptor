This document describes the KS-19 Russian 100mm Towed Anti-Aircraft Gun.

Hezbollah Proliferation. The KS-19 is a heavy towed anti-aircraft gun that has largely disappeared from front-line arsenals due to the increased use of more effective surface-to-air missiles. Being a towed weapon an external form of mobility was required, usually an AT-S Medium or AT-T Heavy tracked artillery tractor. The 15 man crew were carried on the tractor along with ready-use ammunition for the gun. Ammunition was loaded as a single round into the loading tray and a well-trained crew could fire 15 rounds maximum per minute.


Anti Aircraft ammunition includes high explosive, high explosive fragmentation, and fragmentation types. The KS-19's onboard sights can be used to engage air targets; however, increased accuracy was achieved if used in conjunction with a fire control radar such as the SON 9 (NATO Reporting name 'Fire Can') and PUAZO-6/19 director.

As the KS-19 is a heavy caliber Anti-Aircraft gun it also has some utility in the ground role, especially against armored targets. As a result of this two armor-piercing rounds were produced: the AP-T (Armor Piercing-Tracer) and APC-T (Armor Piercing Capped-Tracer) with the AP-T round reportedly able to penetrate 185 mm of armor at 1000 m.

The KS-19 was used in action by communist forces in both Korea and Vietnam.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Armenia, Cambodia, Congo, Cuba, Guinea, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Mauritania, Nicaragua, Non-State Actors, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Romania, Sudan, Syria, Viet Nam, Yemen.
