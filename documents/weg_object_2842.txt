This document describes the 1V13 (M1974-1) Russian Artillery Command and Reconnaissance Vehicle.

The set provides the command and control vehicles for the self-propelled cannon battalions.  The eight-vehicle set consists of three 1V13 battery senior officers' vehicles, three 1V14 battery commander's vehicles, one 1V15 battalion commander's vehicle, and one 1V16 battalion FDC/chief of staff's vehicle.  The 1V12M Faltset ACRV set is a modernized version of the system.  The installation of an upgraded electronics package in the vehicles created the requirement for an external-mounted power generator.  In addition to freeing a small amount of space inside the vehicle, the external mounting reduces the internal noise level.  
The ACRV 1V13 is the battery FDC of the 1V12 ACRV complex.  The battery senior officer, assisted by fire direction and communication personnel, mans the vehicle.  It has direct radio communications with the battery COP, the battalion COP, and the battalion FDC.  The vehicle is equipped with a land navigation system and has a roof-mounted periscopic aiming circle.  The roof-mounted periscopic aiming circle allows the battery senior officer the ability to lay the howitzers for direction from within his vehicle.  There is no battlefield observation equipment present on the 1V13.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Russian Federation.
