This document describes the 9K512 (Uragan-1M) Russian 220mm/300mm Multiple Launch Rocket System (MRL).

The 9K512 (Uragan-1M) Russian 220mm/300mm Multiple Launch Rocket System (MRL) was presented to the public in 2007, all processes of the Uragan are automated.  The Uragan can fire the 300mm rockets of the BM-30 Smerch system.  Reloading is simplified by substituting launch tubes; can be fitted with two banks of six 300mm launch tubes or fifteen 220mm launch tubes.  
Deliveries to the Russian army started in September 2016.  The Uragan-1M is based on an 8x8 military truck chassis, MZKT-7930, developed in Belarus early 1990s.  The forward control cab of the MZKT-7930 accommodates the driver and two passengers.  The Uragan-1M is fitted with two launcher pods, each containing two layers of three rockets ready to fire, giving a total of 12 launch tubes.  The rocket launcher station is mounted on a turntable at the rear of the truck chassis with powered elevation and traverse.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
