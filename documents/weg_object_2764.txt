Here is Protection information for the M1079 American 4x4 Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) Van:
The Armor is Current and recent operational scenarios now call for logistic trucks of the FMTV type to at least have the option of cab armoring. When it entered production, armoring was not considered an option for the FMTV. The first protection solution for the FMTV was not in answer to such scenarios, but was developed by Stewart & Stevenson and O'Gara-Hess & Eisenhardt Armoring Company (OHE). Called the Crew Protected Cab, it was specifically for the HIMARS variant and offered flash and Foreign Object Debris (FOD) protection during launch. Designs followed for an Enhanced Crew Protected Cab, and later an Armor Protected Cab, each adding more ballistic capability against direct fire, artillery burst and mines..
The Applique Armor is To meet emerging threats on deployed operations, in March 2004 DRS Technical Services was awarded a $16.3 million contract to provide 272 armor protection kits for the FMTV. A total of 1,862 kits are understood to have been produced in total. These kits were based around ballistic-protection panels installed on standard FMTV cabs.

In answer to demands for greater crew protection, BAE Systems developed the Low Signature Armored Cab (LSAC) for all variants of the FMTV. The LSAC replaced the standard FMTV cab (with which it shares internals) in a remove and replace operation.

To meet the US Army's current Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) for armored cabs, BAE Systems developed the LTAS cab for the FMTV. BAE Systems states that it produced over 9,000 LTAS cabs for the FMTV A1P2 variant. All Oshkosh FMTV vehicles include the company's own LTAS-compliant armor solution.

LTAS is based around the A and B kit principles, this allowing for vehicles to be armored as required, and with the add-on applique package adaptable to prevailing threats and upgradeable as new armoring technologies emerge. The A-Kit, which includes a new cab, modifies the FMTV to allow the addition of armour; the B-Kit being the bulk of the armor itself..
The Active Protection System is No.
The NBC Protection is INA.
The Smoke Equipment is INA.
