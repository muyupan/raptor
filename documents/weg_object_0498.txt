Here is Variants information for the 9A52-2 (BM-30 Smerch-M) Russian 300mm Multiple Launch Rocket System:
The 9A52-2T Smerch is A variant based on the Tatra 10x10 chassis. It was designed in Russia for the Indian MoD. This rocket system is in service with the Indian Army..
The 9A52-4 Tornado i is A lighter variant of the Smerch, based on KamAZ 8x8 truck. It has a six-pack launcher pod for 300 mm rockets. So the 9A52-4 has half the firepower of the Smerch. The whole launcher pod is replaced after all rockets are fired. This system is compatible with 90 km rockets.
The Uragan-1M i is A new Russian artillery rocket system, that might become a replacement for the aging Uragan and Smerch systems. It was first publicly revealed in 2016. The Uragan-1M carries two launching pods for 300 mm or 220 mm rockets. These rocket pods are interchangeable with those of the 9A52-4 Tornado system. The launcher vehicle is based on an MZKT-7930 high-mobility chassis with 8x8 configuration..
The PHL 03 is A Chinese copy of the Smerch. It was adopted by the Chinese army in 2004-2005. It incorporates newer technologies, as well as indigenous Chinese rockets with a maximum range of 130 km. China developed a number of indigenous versions of this artillery rocket system..
The Olha is A Ukrainian version of the Smerch, which uses newly developed missiles, possibly with extended range. The Oliha uses the same launcher vehicle of the Smerch. It was planned that tests of this system will be completed in 2018 and production will commence..
