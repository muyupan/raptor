This document describes the LG1 French 105mm Towed Howitzer.

The LG1 is a modern 105 mm towed howitzer designed and produced by GIAT Industries (now Nexter group) of France. The LG1 howitzer is a 105 mm towed artillery piece that features both low weight and a high level of accuracy over long distances. Its lightweight construction gives the barrel a relatively short lifespan. The equivalent full charge (EFC) count is suggested to be approximately 7,500; however, during fire and practice, has yielded only around 1,500 EFCs. The gun was specifically designed for use by rapid deployment forces with attributes such as ruggedness, ease of operation, and reduced weight. It can fire all NATO standard 105 mm ammunition up to a range of 18.5 and 19.5 kilometers (11.5 and 12.1 mi) using HE-ER G2 and US M913 rounds.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand.

Here is Variants information for the LG1 French 105mm Towed Howitzer:
The LG1 Mk II is This variant is an LG1 Mk I with a autofrettaged barrel (a method of pre-stressing the barrel hydraulically during production to instill greater strength); this allows the use of more powerful, longer range ammunition. The layout of the recoil system is improved to simplify maintenance and the shield is removed to reduce weight..
The LG1 Mk III is This is an upgrade proposed by Nexter that includes an inertial three-dimensional aiming and positioning system and muzzle-velocity radar, which could be connected to the EADS STAREM command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) system..
The LG1 Mk IV/V is These are proposed upgrades to the LG1. The Mk IV would add automatic aiming and require a reduced crew of three. The Mk V would add automatic loading..
The M101 upgrade is Giat Industries (now Nexter) developed an upgrade kit for the U.S.-built M101 105-mm howitzer that involves replacing the original 23-caliber barrel with the 30-caliber barrel used by the LG1. The kit has been ordered by Thailand and the Philippines..
