This document describes the PLL-05 (Type 05) Chinese 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar.

PLL-05 (Type 05) Chinese 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar Howitzer (SPMH) in use by Chinese mechanized infantry formations. Conceptually it is similar to the Russian 2S23 "Nona-SVK" (the turret and weapon system of the 2S9 Nona mounted on a BTR-80 chassis) three of which China purchased for evaluation.  At one time it was reported that China would purchase 100 of the Russian vehicles however, this failed to occur, nor does it appear that there was a formal transfer of technology to China. The Chinese system features a longer barreled weapon mounted on the Type 92 variant of the WZ551 armored personnel carrier. The PLL-05 (Type 05) Chinese 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar Howitzer (SPMH) is based on the WZ-551 6x6 wheeled chassis, which is already in use for various other roles. For instance, the ZSL-92 infantry fighting vehicle is common in Chinese service. The main armament is the breach-loaded 120mm gun/mortar that is connected to a semi-automatic loader. The maximum effective range is 8.5 km for 120mm mortar rounds, 9.5 km for a howitzer-like projectile, and 12.8 km for rocket-assisted mortar shells. It is mainly used for indirect fire but is also capable of direct fire using both HE and HEAT-FS shells up to 1.2 km. The maximum rate of fire is 6 to 10 rounds per minute. Secondary armament consists of the 12.7mm QJC88 heavy machine gun which is mounted on the turret roof. The QJC88 is used for self-defense against nearby infantry, light armored vehicles, and helicopters.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
