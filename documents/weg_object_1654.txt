This document describes the Neustrashimy-Class (Project 11540 Class) Russian Frigate.

Neustrashimy Class (Project 11540 Class) Russian Frigate was originally designed as the successor to the GRISHA class, but due to weakness in the Russian economy, only two were completed. The Neustrashimy class (Russian: Неустрашимый, alternate English spelling Neustrashimyy), Soviet designation Project 11540 Yastreb (hawk), is a series of large frigates built for the Soviet Navy and currently in service with the Russian Navy. Seven ships were planned for the Soviet Navy, but the fall of the Soviet Union disrupted those plans. Two ships were completed, both currently in active service with the Russian Baltic Fleet.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
