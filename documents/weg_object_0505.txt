This document describes the M-1985 North Korean 240mm Multiple Rocket Launcher.

The M-1985 North Korean 240mm Multiple Rocket Launcher, developed in North Korea. It was first observed by US intelligence in 1985. The number in the designation indicates the year it was first observed. This artillery system was produced in quantity. According to some reports, North Korea has about 200 of these launchers in service. Large numbers of these systems are located north of the demilitarized zone and are targeted towards South Korea. The DPRK has about 500 various long-range artillery systems within the range of Seoul. This artillery system has been exported to Iran.

   Despite its simplistic appearance, the M1985 is a very capable system. At the time of its introduction, it was one of the most capable artillery rocket systems in the world. In some cases, it even outperformed a contemporary Soviet Uragan and a US M270 MLRS.

   This artillery rocket system is intended to engage important enemy targets, such as concentrations of troops and armored vehicles, command posts, artillery batteries, radar sites, airfields, as well as other important targets. The range of this system allows to strike targets behind enemy lines. This rocket system can also engage hostile warships.

   The M1985 has 12 launching tubes for 240 mm unguided spin-stabilized rockets. The type is easily identified by its two rows of 6 tubes. A standard HE-FRAG warhead weighs 90 kg and contains 45 kg of high explosives. Other types of warheads exist, including incendiary, smoke, and chemical. It is claimed that the maximum range of fire is 43 km.

   The operator can launch all rockets in full salvo, or just individual rockets manually. This artillery system can launch one rocket every 4 or 8 seconds. So it takes 48 to 96 seconds to launch all 12 rockets.

   Four manually-operated stabilizing jacks have to be lowered, prior to the rockets being launched. Elevation and traverse controls are also manually operated. The vehicle can leave the firing position within 2 minutes.

   The M1985 MLRS is based on a Japanese Isuzu 6x6 truck. The same chassis is used for the North Korean 122 mm MLRS. This launcher pack can be also adapted to any suitable cross-country truck.

   Behind the vehicle cabin, there is another cabin for the crew. This artillery rocket system is operated by a crew of around 5 men. The forward control cab accommodates 3 crew members, while the rest are seated in the rear cab.

   The M1985 is supported by a reloading vehicle, which carries one complete reload and is fitted with a crane. Reloading would normally be carried out well away from the firing position, to avoid counter-battery fire. A typical battery of the M1985 consists of five launching vehicles.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Myanmar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).
