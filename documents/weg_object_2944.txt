This document describes the Leer-3 Russian 6x6 Mobile Drone-Based Electronic Warfare (EW) System.

Russia’s new drone-based electronic-warfare system, the Leer-3, RB-341V combines jammers and Orlan-10 unmanned aerial vehicles to disable cellular networks, and allow the Russian military to send fake messages to subscribers.
The Leer-3 UAV can effectively become a ‘virtual cellular station’ by sending messages and controlling a subscriber’s devices once it replaces a base station.  If it manages to take the place of a cellular communications tower, it can also send audio messages and small video clips to subscribers.
The Leer-3 has some psychological warfare mission implications.  The Leer-3 can block enemy mobile telephones while, simultaneously, not impeding the operation of friendly mobile phones.  The system can collect telephone numbers and call these numbers while blocking other phones’ signals.  It may also be able to remotely connect user devices.

The Leer-3 complex is composed of three Orlan-10 UAVs and a command and control post on a KamAZ-5350 truck.  The unmanned aerial vehicles’ primary mission is to suppress cellular communication towers.  To do this, special ‘jammers’ have been installed onboard the Orlan-10 UAVs, along with disposable jammers, which they drop onto the ground.  After jamming the base stations, the Orlan-10 UAVs are able to send instant messages to subscribers given the necessary conditions.
A single KAMAZ heavy truck controls three Orlan-10s, one of which acts as a communications relay while the others carry both airborne jammers and disposable jammers they drop to the ground.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
