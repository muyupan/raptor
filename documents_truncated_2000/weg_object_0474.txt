This document describes the Type 74 Chinese 284mm Anti-Tank Mine Multiple Rocket Launcher.

The Type 74 284-mm multiple rocket launcher fires heavy rockets that plant anti-tank mines. The system, mounted on the bed of a 6 x 6-wheel CA-30A truck, elevates and traverses a row of five rails.
Each I-beam rail is 4.0 m long and holds a rocket above and below the rail. Each rocket carries 10 Type 69 or Type 70 plastic-case anti-tank mines.

To lay a minefield covering 400 sq m, a battery of four Type 74 launchers fires a salvo of rockets each, planting 400 mines. All 10 rockets can be launched in 15 seconds.

Note: NORINCO developed a newer solid propellant, 284 mm Type 85 mine-laying rocket shell. This has a maximum range of 3,500 m and contains 10 anti-tank mines. A complete battery salvo (4 launchers) has a laying zone of 700 Ã— 500 m. The unguided solid propellant rockets are 2.6m long and weigh 156kg at launch.

The vehicle cab is fitted with steel shutters that can be closed over the cab windows for blast protection. It accommodates two of the six crew members; the other four ride on an open bench seat behind the cab.

Small stabilizing jacks are dropped from the rear of the truck bed to steady the vehicle during firing.

The launcher entered service in the mid-1970s. It is no longer in production. There have been no known exports and NORINCO has ceased marketing the system, according to Jane's Armour and Artillery for Feb. 18, 2003.
There are no known Type 74s in Chinese military service; the CA-30A truck utilized is obsolescent and no longer in production. However, it is possible that launchers could be fitted on a newer chassis in the future.
