This document describes the TOS-1A Solntsepek Russian 220mm Heavy Flamethrower System.

The TOS-1A Solntsepek Russian 220mm Heavy Flamethrower System is an improved version of the TOS-1. Its launch vehicle is designated BM-1 and is designed to perform the same missions as the original vehicle. However, it has an increased range as a result of longer rockets.The primary effect of the TOS-1A’s rockets is a long-duration high-pressure blast wave which creates a vacuum, then precipitates a reverse wave. These pressure/vacuum surges up to 427 psi = 300,210.392948 kgf/m² (427 pounds per sq inch) cause a ripping effect on soft materials (such as airplane skin, radar surface, human lung tissue). Walls and surfaces within the affected area do not necessarily shield victims, rather cause multiple pressure waves, which amplify the tearing effects and can topple structures. A secondary effect is high-temperature heat at 2,500-3,000° C (4,532- 5,432° F). An incomplete explosion renders a near-devastating effect, with a wide-area long-duration high-temperature flame. Even those outside of the blast area will be rendered ineffective with debilitating mental and physical trauma.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, CFE Treaty, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Syria.
