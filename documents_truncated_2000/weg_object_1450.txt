This document describes the Project 22220 Class (Arktika Class) Russian Nuclear-Powered Icebreaker.

The Project 22220 Class (Arktika Class) Russian Nuclear-Powered Icebreaker was ordered from Baltic Shipyard on 3 July 2012. Construction started in 2013, the ship was launched on 16 May 2016 and entered service in October 2020. The Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker will primarily aid shipping for vessels carrying hydrocarbons from deposits located on Yamal and Gydan peninsulas and the continental shelf of the Kara Sea to markets in the Atlantic and Pacific countries. The nuclear reactors aboard will let the vessel operate without refueling for years and enable it to break the ice up to 2.8m thick.

The multipurpose vessel will also be used for exploration of offshore and onshore fields, transportation of goods, and fishing.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
