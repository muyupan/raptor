This document describes the YJ-12B Chinese Coastal Defense Missile System.

The YJ-12B is a new China's coastal defense missile system. Its images first emerged in 2018. This system was first publicly revealed in 2019. It is in service with the China's military.

It is a general purpose heavy duty missile transporter developed from the original WS2500 and is built by Wanshan Special Vehicle. Its other contemporary is the larger HTF5680A1.

The WS2600 is a heavy duty TEL co-developed by a joint Chinese and Belarusian venture. The WS2600 is slightly bigger than the WS2500 and a larger version of the original WS2400 with an additional axle to support the increased payload.

Due to its larger size, the WS2600 is able to carry much heftier missiles, of which its most common payload is the DF-21C medium-range ballistic missile and the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile. Both the WS2500 and WS2600 form one of the main TEL carriers of China's MRBM and ASBM stockpiles.

Like the WS2500, the TEL has a 4-door cab, which allows the WS2600 to easily accommodates the driver and 7 additional passengers.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
