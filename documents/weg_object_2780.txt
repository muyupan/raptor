This document describes the MTU-20 Russian Armored Vehicle-Launched Bridge (AVLB) System.

The MTU-20 AVLB is a replacement system that is 60% more capable, in terms of bridge length, than the MTU-1. The primary mission system of the MTU-20 is the three-part bridge. Unlike the MTU-1, stabilizers are fitted to the front of the MTU-20 to provide a more stable platform when the bridge is being maneuvered into position. The bridge can be used to cross anti-tank obstacles or as reinforcement for other bridges or soft terrain that is incapable of supporting the weight of heavy vehicles.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Finland, India, Nigeria, Russian Federation, Syria.
