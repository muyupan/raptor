This document describes the Oscar II-Class (Project 949A Antey Class) Russian Nuclear-Powered Cruise Missile Submarine.

The OSCAR II-class SSGNs are the second-largest submarines in the world, second only to the U.S. OHIO class SSBN/SSGNs. SSGN Oscar II class cruise-missile submarines (Project 949A/Antey class) are designed primarily to attack NATO aircraft carriers, battle groups. To cope with its resource problems, the Russian Navy, in the early 1990s, made an effort at preserving its core submarine force capabilities.

The Russian Navy continued to invest in new construction. In the late 1990s, it completed several new submarines of the third generation Oscar II. 11 of the larger Oscar II submarines were built between 1985 and 1999 at the Sevmash yard in Severodvinsk. Three have been decommissioned and one, the Kursk, sank. Two Oscar II submarines are active with the Northern Fleet and five with the Pacific Fleet.

The Pacific Fleet is set to upgrade four Oscar II submarines with 3M-54 Kalibr family of cruise missiles by 2021 as part of a multi-year program. The submarines can also be fitted with other cruise missiles, including 3M-54 anti-ship, 3M-14 land-attack missiles, and PT91 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) torpedoes.

The upgraded submarines will be designated Project 949AM.

Eleven Project 949A Antey submarines were completed at Severodvinsk, of which five were assigned to the Soviet Northern Fleet. At one stage it had been planned to develop a new fourth-generation follow-on to Project 949A, but this plan was later dropped. The external differences between the two classes were that the 949A class is about 10 meters (33 ft) longer than its predecessor (approximately 154 meters, 505 ft rather than 143 m, 469 ft), providing space and buoyancy for improved electronics and quieter propulsion.

Some sources speculate that the acoustic performance of the Oscar II class is superior to the early Akula class but inferior to the Akula II class as well as subsequent (4th generation) designs. It also has a larger fin, and its propellers have seven blades instead of four.

Like all post-World War II Soviet designs, they are of double hull construction. Similarly, like other Soviet submarine designs, Project 949 not only has a bridge open to the elements on top of the sail but, for use in inclement weather, there is an enclosed bridge forward and slightly below this station. A distinguishing mark is a slight bulge at the top of the fin. A large door on either side of the fin reaches this bulge. These are wider at the top than on the bottom and are hinged on the bottom. The Federation of American Scientists reports that this submarine carries an emergency crew escape capsule; it is possible that these doors cover it. The VSK escape capsule can accommodate 110 people

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

The Note is Modernization: The Rubin Design Bureau started working on Project 949A modernization in 2011, with Zvezdochka and Zvezda shipyards to carry out modernization of the vessels. In September 2015, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced during his visit to Zvezda shipyard, that at least three Oscar-class submarines will undergo repair and modernization to extend their service life by 20 years. The upgraded submarines will be known as "Project 949AM", according to the Russian officials. Modernization cost was estimated at RUB12 billion (US$182 million) per submarine.

In September 2016, it was reported submarines K-132 Irkutsk and K-442 Chelyabinsk are currently being modernized to 949AM. According to the Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Yury Borisov, Russia's Pacific Fleet may get four modernized Oscar II-class submarines armed with Kalibr cruise missiles by 2021..

The Maximum Speed is Mach 1+.
The Range is 630 km.
The Blast Yield is 500 kt.
The Note is Strategic Implications: Designed to defend against United States’ Navy carrier battle grounds, the Granit remains strategically valuable today because of its unique guidance system. When fired in a swarm (group of 4-8 weapons), one of the weapons climbs to a higher altitude and designates targets while the others attack. If the designating missile is destroyed, another missile will rise to take over the same purpose. They attack targets in order of priority, highest to lowest, using information gathered on targets during flight. The missile can also counter attacking anti-missiles and its on-board computer carries data to evade electronic countermeasures, ensuring a successful target hit. Due to the missile’s size, it can only be deployed in small numbers on Oscar-class submarines, Kirov-class battlecruisers, and the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier. In the future, it is possible that the Granit missiles will be replaced with smaller Oniks and Kalibr cruise missiles in greater numbers..
