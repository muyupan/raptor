This document describes the JRTC VISMOD: BMP-3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle.

The BMP-3 is one of the most heavily armed infantry combat vehicles in service, fitted with several different weapon systems capable of ranging out to 5.2km.  It carries a 3 man crew plus 7 infantrymen, and is capable of firing all weapons on the move with no loss of effectiveness.  This makes it crucial asset for the threat.  While most variants will have a 30mm auto cannon, reports indicate that a variant with a 100mm rifled gun may be in production.

Although Explosive Reactive Armor is available for the BMP-3, the threat will likely not use it in environments / situations where there will be extensive use of dismounted infantry in the area in order to prevent injuring soldiers in the vicinity of the vehicle. 

The BMP-3 [BMP = Boyevaya Mashina Pyekhota - Infantry Fighting Vehicle], which represents a totally different design concept from BMP-1/2, is a light tank that can hold a squad of infantry. It has a 100mm main gun that fires HE to destroy buildings, can fire long-range ATGMs, a 30mm auto-cannon and a medium machine gun as a single unit in the turret. The innovative BMP-3 armament suite has been subjected to criticism in the Russian military.  
The performance obtained from the 500 horsepower engine powering this 20.6 ton vehicle compares favorably to the American Bradley, which has an engine of similar power. The BMP-3, first seen in public during a parade in Moscow in 1990, was built by Kurganmashzavod, developer and manufacturer of the BMP-2 infantry combat vehicle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the JRTC VISMOD: BMP-3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle:

The BMP-3K lacks the bow machine guns and has its whip antennas mounted on the rear hull. Crew: 3+3.
The BMP-3F is Armed with the standard 2K23 turret. Specially designed for operations at sea, with improved seaworthiness and buoyancy, capability to move afloat at sea state 3 and fire with the required accuracy at sea state 2. Compared to the basic model, the vehicle design features changes increasing floatability and vehicle stability: the self-entrenching equipment is omitted, a lightweight anti-surge vane and an air intake tube are introduced; the BMP-3F turret is also protected by anti-surge vanes. Water jet propellers develop a speed of 10 km/h when afloat. The BMP-3F design allows the vehicle to come ashore under rough sea conditions and to tow the same-type vehicle.

A related version is the Kornet self-propelled anti-tank missile complex. This variant provides a ready-round capacity of 16 missiles in two ready-launch drums. It is estimated that the vehicle has capacity for 16 reload missiles. The Kornet ATGM is designed by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau. Integration on the BMP-3 is performed by the Volsk Mechanical Plant in Saratov.
