This document describes the CRJ900 Canadian Regional Jet.

The Bombardier CRJ700, CRJ900, and CRJ1000 (after June 2020, the Mitsubishi CRJ) are a family of regional jet airliners designed and manufactured by Canadian transportation conglomerate Bombardier; this aircraft trio has been collectively marketed by the company as the CRJ Series. Their design was derived from the smaller CRJ100 and 200 airliners.

During the 1990s, Bombardier initiated development on the CRJ-X, a program to produce enlarged derivatives of its popular CRJ100/200 family. Officially launched in 1997, the CRJ700's maiden flight took place on 27 May 1999; it was soon followed by the stretched CRJ900 variant. Several additional variants of the type were subsequently introduced, including the CRJ550 and the elongated CRJ1000. While production of the smaller CRJ100/200 range was discontinued during 2006, the larger CRJ Series models have continued to be produced into the 2010s. Competitors have included the Fokker 70/Fokker 100, the BAe 146 family, and the Embraer E-Jet family.

In Bombardier's lineup, the CRJ Series was formerly marketed alongside a family of larger jets, the C Series (now majority-owned by Airbus and marketed as the Airbus A220) and a twin-turboprop, the Q Series (now owned by De Havilland Canada and marketed as the Dash 8). During the late 2010s, Bombardier sought to sell off several of its aircraft programs. The CRJ program was acquired by Japanese corporation Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal that closed 1 June 2020.

The CRJ900 is a stretched 76–90 seat version of the CRJ700. The first CRJ900 (C-FRJX) was modified from the prototype CRJ700 by adding longer fuselage plugs fore and aft of the wings. It was later converted into the prototype CRJ1000 by replacing the fuselage plugs with longer plugs. The CRJ900 also features strakes located at the rear of the plane. The CRJ900 competes with the Embraer 175, and is more efficient per seat-mile, according to Bombardier. Mesa Air Group was the launch customer for the CRJ900 painted in America West livery. The FAA Type Certificate designation of the CRJ900 is the CL-600-2D24.

The wing is wider with added leading edge slats, the tail is redesigned. The cabin floor has been lowered 2 inches which gains outward visibility from the windows in the cabin as the windows become closer to eye level height. The cabin has a re-circulation fan which aids in cooling and heating. The environmental packs have a target temperature instead of a hot-cold knob. The APU is a Honeywell RE220 unit,[68] which supplies much more air to the AC packs and has higher limits for starting and altitude usage.

The aircraft features two GE CF34-8C5 engines, 59.4 kN (13,400 lbf) thrust with APR. The engines are controlled by FADEC digital engine control instead of control cables and a fuel control unit. In typical service, the CRJ900 can cruise 8–10,000 ft higher with a slightly higher fuel burn and an average true airspeed of 450–500 knots, a significant improvement over its predecessor. Its maximum ground takeoff weight is 84,500 pounds.

In 2018, the CRJ900's list price was $48 million while its market value was $24M; reportedly, most customers are paying around $20–22M and the American Airlines order for 15 was at below $20M. A 2012 aircraft was worth less than $14M and it was to fall by 30% in 2021.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Canada, China, France, United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the CRJ900 Canadian Regional Jet:
The CRJ700 is Design work on the CRJ700 by Bombardier started in 1995 and the program was officially launched in January 1997. The CRJ700 is a stretched derivative of the CRJ200. The CRJ700 features a new wing with leading edge slats and a stretched and slightly widened fuselage, with a lowered floor. Its first flight took place on 27 May 1999. The aircraft's FAA Type Certificate designation is the CL-600-2C10. The CRJ700 first entered commercial service with Brit Air in 2001..
The CRJ550 is On 6 February 2019, Bombardier launched the CRJ550, based on the CRJ700, with 50 seats in three classes. The launch customer, United Airlines, ordered 50 aircraft configured with 10 first class, 20 Economy Plus and 20 economy seats. The aircraft were to be operated under the United Express brand by regional partner GoJet Airlines. The CRJ550 has a lower maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) than the CRJ700, to comply with scope clauses in US pilot contracts, and a lower maximum landing weight (MLW). It received type certification in the second half of 2019. The initial 50 aircraft will be sourced from existing CRJ700s, rather than being newly constructed. On 7 August 2019, United Airlines' regional partner GoJet Airlines took delivery of the aircraft and began with a crew familiarization flight to Chicago-O’Hare International Airport (ORD)..

The FAA Type Certificate designation of the CRJ900 is the CL-600-2D24..
The CRJ705 is The CRJ700 Series 705 is based on the CRJ900, featuring a business class cabin and a reduced maximum seating capacity to allow operation with regional airlines. The Series 705 seats 75 passengers. Some regional airlines have scope clauses with their major airlines that limit the maximum passenger capacity of aircraft they operate. The Air Canada Pilots Association negotiated a scope agreement with Air Canada limiting the maximum seating capacity of any jet aircraft at Air Canada Express to 75 seats. Air Canada Jazz was the launch customer for this aircraft in 2005 with 10 Executive Class and 65 Economy Class seats, all fitted with personal audio/video-on-demand systems. The FAA Type Certificate designation of the CRJ705 is the CL-600-2D15. Jazz Aviation, a subsidiary of Chorus Aviation, operated 16 CRJ705s on behalf of Air Canada and was the only operator of this version. On 26 April 2016, Jazz Aviation announced that existing CRJ705 aircraft in operation will be converted to CRJ900 with 76 seats. As of late February 2018, all CRJ-705s have been reconfigured with 12 Executive Class and 64 Economy Class seats, which changed their FAA Type Certificate to CL-600-2D24..
The CRJ1000 is On 19 February 2007, Bombardier launched the development of the CRJ1000, previously designated CRJ900X, as a stretched CRJ900, with up to 100 seats. The CRJ1000 completed its first production flight on 28 July 2009 in Montreal; the entry into service was planned then for the first quarter of 2010. A month after the first flight, however, a fault in the rudder controls forced the flight-test program to be grounded : the program was not resumed until February 2010, and deliveries were projected to begin by January 2011. Brit Air and Air Nostrum were the launch customers for the CRJ1000..
