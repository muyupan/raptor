This document describes the BRDM-1 Russian 4x4 Amphibious Armored Scout Car.

The BRDM-1 four-wheel-drive amphibious scout car first appeared in the spring of 1959 and rapidly became the standard light-wheeled reconnaissance vehicle in most of the Warsaw Pact armies. It was replaced by the newer BRDM-2 and the Hungarian FUG scout cars. Resembling a cross between the GAZ-46 (MAY) amphibious jeep and the BTR-40 armored personnel carrier, the BRDM combines amphibious features with a full armored cover. Cross-country ability is heightened by the use of a centralized tire pressure regulation system and through the use of two sets of small belly wheels which can be lowered to add flotation and assist in crossing gaps.

The BRDM-1 reconnaissance 4X4 vehicle was built in a number of variants, including the BRDM-1Rkh NBC Reconnaissance Armoured car and the BRDM-1U wheeled armored command vehicle. Four versions of the BRDM are in existence: the basic BRDM reconnaissance vehicle; the BRDM-rkh radiological-chemical reconnaissance vehicle with marking-flag dispensing devices; the BRDM-U command vehicle distinguishable only by extra radio antennas; and three different antitank guided missile carriers for AT-1 SNAPPER, AT-2 SWATTER, and AT-3 SAGGER antitank missiles. All versions of the BRDM are propelled in the water by a single water jet. Recognition of the BRDM-rkh is facilitated by the presence of two canvas box-shaped devices mounted outboard on the rear deck. These are the marking-flag dispensers.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Bulgaria, Congo, Cuba, Eritrea, Guinea, Mozambique, Russian Federation, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Sudan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Viet Nam, Zambia.
