This document describes the Kasta 2E1 Russian 6x6 Low-Altitude All-Around 3-D Surveillance Radar System.

The Kasta 2E1 system uses two antennas and consists of two vehicles:
one truck carries the antenna and its peripheral equipment
another truck operates as a command post vehicle and on a trailer unit, the external power supply is installed

The Kasta 2E1 and 2E2 are the latest incarnations of the well-established Flat Face and Squat Eye family of semi-mobile UHF band tactical acquisition radars. The initial P-15 Flat Face A introduced the now characteristic double stacked array of elliptical paraboloid section antennas. This radar was widely exported by the Soviets to Warsaw Pact nations and Soviet Third World allies and clients. The radar has been used to support interceptors, as well as SA-3, SA-4, SA-6, and SA-8 missile batteries as an acquisition radar. The P-15M Squat Eye is a derivative of the baseline design with a single antenna on a tethered latticework mast. It was employed to improve low altitude coverage, but also to permit the use of the radar in heavily forested terrain where the height of the foliage canopy exceeded the height of the antenna phase center in the P-15.

The P-19 Flat Face B is the improved follow-on to the P-15 with a range of improvements. Since the 1990s a number of manufacturers are now offering comprehensive digital upgrades for the P-15 and P-19 inventory.

Kasta 2E1 and 2E2 are heavily redesigned derivatives using a new KAMAZ 6 x 6 chassis and mostly digital hardware. The redesign of the Squat Eye antenna is the most visually prominent change with the increased aperture improving range performance.

Due to their low power-aperture ratings, this family of radars is generally not regarded to be particularly effective against LO and VLO aircraft.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
