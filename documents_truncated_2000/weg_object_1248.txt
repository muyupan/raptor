This document describes the 9K37 Buk-M1 (SA-11 Gadfly) Russian Medium-Range Surface-to-Air Missile System.

The BUK-M1 (NATO reporting name: SA-11 Gadfly) missile system is a self-propelled, medium-range surface-to-air missile system developed by the Russian defense industry. The SA-11 Gadfly is intended to defeat tactical and strategic aircraft, cruise missiles, helicopters, and other aerodynamics targets throughout the entire range of their combat employment in severe ECM environment, as well as Lance-type tactical ballistic missile, HARM-type antiradar missiles, and other airborne and ground-based high precision weapons and to engage waterborne and radio-contrast ground targets. 

The first version of BUK-M1 adopted into service carried the GRAU designation 9K37 and was identified in the west with the NATO reporting name "SA-11 Gadfly". Since its initial introduction into service, the BUK-M1 missile system has been continually upgraded and refined with the latest incarnation carrying the designation 9K37M2 "BUK-M2". SA-11 Gadfly battery requires 5 minutes to set up before it is ready for engagement and can be ready for transit again in 5 minutes. The reaction time of the battery from target tracking to missile launch is around 22 seconds

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Egypt, Georgia, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).

It incorporates an IFF interrogator, optical tracker, datalink, and is powered by the TELAR's gas turbine generator. A shared antenna is employed for two X-band transmit/receive channels. These respectively provide a pulsed mode for search and track functions, with linear chirp for compression, and a CW mode for illumination. Monopulse angle tracking is employed for jam resistance. For target tracking the antenna and feed system provide a mainlobe with 2.5° width in azimuth and 1.3° in elevation. For CW illumination the antenna and feed system provide a mainlobe with 1.4° width in azimuth and 2.65° in elevation.

Operating autonomously, the 9S35 will take 4 seconds to sweep a 120° sector, with an elevation of 6° to 7°. When cued to acquire and track, with will take 2 seconds to sweep a 10° x 7° az/elev solid angle. Average power output in pulsed tracking modes varies between 0.5 and 1 kiloWatt, with CW illumination at 2 kiloWatts. The search and monopulse angle tracking receivers are both rated at a Noise Figure of NF=10 dB. The range error is cited at 175 metres, the angular error at less than 1°. The radar can switch from standby mode to combat operation in twenty seconds..
