This document describes the QBZ-03 (Type 03) Chinese 5.8mm Assault Rifle.

The QBZ-03 ("light rifle automatic") assault rifle, also known as the Type 03, is a Chinese gas-operated, selective-fire assault rifle designed and developed for the 5.8×42mm DBP87 round.

Unlike the bullpup QBZ-95, the QBZ-03 is a weapon of conventional design. The weapon is designed to be easily used by soldiers already familiar with previously issued rifles and machine guns.

The QBZ-03 has a two-piece receiver largely made up of forged aluminum alloy with the stock, pistol grip, and handguards being made of a polymer compound. The gas block has two position regulators, one for firing standard ammunition, the other to allow the use of rifle grenades. The sights are of a hooded front sight with a flip-up rear diopter sight similar to the American M16 rifle. A scope rail is available to allow the use of various optics. The QBZ-03 has seen some issues within the People's Armed Police, People's Liberation Army Marine Corps, People's Liberation Army Air Force Paratroopers, and second-line PLA ground units.

The weapon has a faster rate of fire compared to QBZ-95. The operating system is similar to Type 81 assault rifle featuring rotating bolt locking and short-stroke gas piston.

An export variant of the QBZ-03 also exists, first introduced in 2005 by the joint CJAIE (China Jing-An Import-Export) and Jiang-She Group Companies. The export version is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO and fed by STANAG magazines. The cyclic rate on the issued model is semi-automatic or fully automatic-only, while the export model has an integrated three-round burst mode. The type's most notable public display was by the PLA Airforce Airborne Troops during the October 1st 2009 60th Anniversary Parade. The assault rifle was also featured in the 2015 Victory Day Parade.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Myanmar.
