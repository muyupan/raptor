This document describes the PKT Russian 7.62mm General-Purpose Machine Gun.

The PKT is a solenoid-fired coaxial version of PK to replace the SGMT Goryunov vehicle-mounted machine gun. Modifications include the removal of the stock, a longer and heavier barrel, a gas regulator, and an electric solenoid trigger. The PKT is usually fed from 250-round ammunition boxes. The PKT barrel assembly weighs 3.23 kg (7.1 lb) and can fire up to 500 rounds in rapid-fire scenarios before it has to be replaced for another barrel or allowed to cool down to prevent unacceptable wear of the bore.
