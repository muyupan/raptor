This document describes the ASLAV-F Australian 8x8 Amphibious Armored Maintenance Support Vehicle.

The Fitters MRIK provides a HIAB 650 Special hydraulic crane with a lift capacity of some 4000kg and which slews approximately 260º. Two hydraulically operated outriggers are located between the second and third roadwheel stations, and these provide support during lifting operations. On the right of the hull top, adjacent the crane, is located a stowage box carrying additional stabilisers and stabiliser plates, which can be attached to the rear towing lugs to provide further support during heavy lifting. The Fitters vehicle carries an oxy-acetylene kit, toolboxes, a multi-purpose lifting device for the crane as well as spare parts, enabling power pack and other major assemblies to be changed or repaired in the field.

The Australian Light Armoured Vehicle (ASLAV) is an eight-wheeled amphibious armoured reconnaissance vehicle used by the Australian Army. It was built by General Dynamics Land Systems Canada, and developed from the Canadian Army's LAV-25 and Bison armoured fighting vehicles.

The ASLAV is a highly mobile, eight-wheel drive, amphibious armoured fighting vehicle that can be deployed by land, sea or air (in Royal Australian Air Force C-130s or C-17s). It is fitted with GPS, an intra-vehicular navigation system and a radio harness capable of supporting HF, VHF, UHF and digital radios.

The ASLAV is capable of speeds of 100 km/h (62 mph) and has a maximum range in excess of 660 km (410 mi). The eight-wheel drive provides excellent cross-country mobility and redundancy, the vehicle is capable of operation with only four working wheels, and can continue to operate with eight punctured tyres through the use of solid-core run-flat tyres. It is fully amphibious and is driven in the water by permanent shrouded propellers located at the rear of the hull at speeds of up to 10 km/h (6.2 mph)

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Australia.
