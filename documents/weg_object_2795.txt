This document describes the TMM-3 Russian 6x6 Mobile Bridging System.

The TMM-3 is a heavy mechanized bridge-laying system developed by the former Soviet Union to support its land forces crossing natural obstacles such as rivers and canals as well as ditches. The TMM-3 bridge system supports armored vehicles weighing up to 60 tons at speeds below 15 kilometers per hour (kph) crossing obstacles that are up to 40 meters long and up to three meters deep. Typically a single TMM-3 bridge laying system requires up to four 6x6 KrAZ-255 trucks with each bridge being 10 meters long and can be set up in just 72 minutes.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belarus, CFE Treaty, China, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Viet Nam.
