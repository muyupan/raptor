This document describes the Qasef-1 Iranian Reconnaissance and Loitering Munition Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The Qasef-1 loitering munition is based on the Ababil-2 airframe and has a 30-kg warhead. It has been solely operated by Yemeni Houthis, who have mostly used it to attack the radar components of MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missiles. The Qasef-1 has been in use since late 2016 and some examples have been intercepted in transit to Yemen. It is possibly a renamed or modified Ababil-T with an installed explosive charge or a warhead.

The Houthis claim that they manufacture Qasef-1s themselves, but this claim has been disputed and there is widespread suspicion that it is Iranian-built.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Yemen.
