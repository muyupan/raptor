This document describes the BMD-1 Russian Airborne Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The BMD-1 is an airborne infantry-tracked armored vehicle, which entered the service of the Russian army airborne units in 1969 and was first shown to the public during a parade held in Moscow in November 1973. The vehicle was called the M1970 before its Russian designation became known. Development started in 1965 and limited production began in 1968 and ended in 1969. After operational trials, it was deployed in limited numbers by 1969 and the serial production started in 1970, although the vehicle weight 500 kg more than what the requirements stated (7.5 tonnes and 13.3 tonnes when loaded with equipment). In the late 1970s, a new modernized vehicle received the designation BMD-1P following the adoption of the new 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher instead of 9S428 ATGM launcher, firing the 9M113 "Konkurs" (AT-5 Spandrel). In 1983, based on the combat experience in Afghanistan a decision was made to produce a new variant of the BMD with a weapon capable of engaging targets such as those faced by the airborne troops in that conflict. This resulted in "Ob'yekt 916" which later became BMD-2. A lengthened chassis of BMD-1 served as a basis for the BTR-D airborne multi-purpose tracked APC which itself served as a basis for many specialized airborne vehicles. The BMD-1 is always currently used by the Russian airborne troops. BMD-1 and BMD-1PK IFVs are used by Russian airborne units of KFOR. BMD-1 IFVs were used by Russian airborne units of SFOR.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, CFE Treaty, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam.

Here is Variants information for the BMD-1 Russian Airborne Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV):
The BMD-1 is First production model..
The BMD-1K is (K stands for komandirskaya – command) – Command variant fitted with R-126 and R-107 transceivers, two Clothes Rail antennas and a generator box. It's sometimes called BMD-K..
The BMD-1P is BMD-1 modernization with its 9S428 ATGM launcher replaced by pintle-mounted 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M113 "Konkurs" (AT-5 Spandrel), 9M113M "Konkurs-M" (AT-5B Spandrel B), 9M111 "Fagot" (AT-4 Spigot) and 9M111-2 "Fagot" (AT-4B Spigot B) ATGMs. Entered service in 1977..
The 2S9 NONA Russian 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar (SPM) is The 120 mm SO-120 2S9 Anona (Anemone) self-propelled gun/mortar (SPG/M) was first seen in public in May 1985 and is an airborne artillery assault vehicle that was developed to carry out two tactical functions..
The 2S9-1 Russian 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar (SPM) is 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar (SPM).
The 2S9-1M is The 2S9-1M is an upgraded variant of the baseline SO-120 2S9 Anona-S. The upgraded vehicle is designed to maintain the battlefield viability of the original SO-120 until a replacement - likely to be the Lotus fire support vehicle based on the BMD-4M - can be developed and introduced into service..
The BMD-1PK is (K stands for komandirskaya – command) – Command variant of BMD-1P. It is fitted with an additional R-123M radio set, a generator, the GPK-59 gyroscopic compass, the PRKhR radiation and chemical reconnaissance unit and two attachable tables. The machine gun mounted in the left corner of the bow of the hull has been eliminated as well as one of the seats. The crew consists of 6 men. The ammo load was reduced by one 9M113 "Konkurs" (AT-5 Spandrel) ATGM and 250 7.62 mm machine gun rounds.
The BMD-1M is BMD-1 with smoke grenade launchers on the rear of the turret, improved ventilation and road wheels..
The BMD-2 (Ob'yekt 916) is BMD-1 variant with a new one-man turret armed with stabilized 30 mm 2A42 multi-purpose autocannon and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial tank machine gun (mounted on the right hand side of the main gun). The vehicle carries 300 rounds for the main gun (180 AP and 120 HE) and 2,940 rounds for the machine gun. The gun has a maximum elevation of 75° and can be used to fire at air targets. The turret is also armed with pintle-mounted 9P135M launcher, on the right hand side of the roof of the turret, with semi-automatic control capable of firing SACLOS guided 9M113 "Konkurs" (AT-5 Spandrel) and 9M113M "Konkurs-M" (AT-5B Spandrel B) ATGMs. The new turret seats the gunner on the left hand side of the main gun. On top of the turret there's one single piece circular hatch opening to the front. Located in front of the said hatch is the gunner's sight which is the same one as the one used in BMP-2. Another gunner's sight is located on the left hand side of the main gun and moves in vertical planes along with it. It is a high angle of fire sight used when the gunner is aiming at air targets. The vehicle also has additional periscopes that provide it with vision on the sides. A white searchlight is mounted in front of the turret. The amount of bow mounted tank machine guns decreased from two to one. The right hand side bow mounted machine gun was preserved. NATO gave it the designation BMD M1981/1..
The BTR-D (Ob'yekt 925) is Lengthened variant (with 6 rather than 5 road wheels), slightly up-armoured at the front. The BTR-D has no turret, but is armed with two bow-mounted machine guns PKB and can be fitted with pintle-mounted automatic grenade launchers (AGS-17, AGS-30 or AGS-57) and/or machine guns (PKM, 6P41, "Utyos" or "Kord"). Entered service in 1974 and can carry 10 passengers. Combat weight: 8.5 tons..
