This document describes the BTR-60PA (BTR-60PK) Russian 8x8 Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

BTR-60PA (1963) – This version has an armored roof over the troop compartment. It is fitted with improved 'closed-down vision devices for the crew. Behind the commander's and driver's hatches is a single rear-opening rectangular hatch in front of which is a single mount for the DShK 1938/46 12.7 mm heavy machine gun between the two circular crew hatches at the front of the personnel compartment and two optional mounts for 7.62 mm machine guns (either the PKT, the SGMB or the PKB tank/medium/general-purpose machine guns) on each side of the roof of the personnel compartment. Early production BTR-60PAs only had a single mount for the 7.62 mm machine gun between the two circular crew hatches at the front of the personnel compartment. The small doors on each side of the hull that were present in the BTR-60P were removed. The BTR-60PA introduced a collective NBC protection system to the series. It has six handrails on each side, in rows of three. The personnel compartment has two rectangular hatches. The fact that the roof has been added makes passengers more vulnerable to enemy fire while they're exiting the vehicle through the top hatches. Also, the gunner must be at least shoulder high out of the vehicle to operate the weapons. The vehicle carries 500 rounds for the DShK 1938/46 12.7 mm heavy machine gun and 3,000 rounds for 7.62 mm machine guns. The weight of the vehicle increased from 9.8 tonnes to 10.2 tonnes. It was also known under the designation BTR-60PK, where K stands for krisha – "roof" and GAZ-49A.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Eritrea, Ghana, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Mongolia, Namibia, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), North Macedonia.
