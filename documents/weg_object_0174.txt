This document describes the JN-1601 Chinese HF Intercept and Jamming Station.

The Chinese JN-1601 is a high frequency (HF) communications jammer designed for searching, detection, direction-finding, and jamming of HF radio frequencies. The  jammer is produced by China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation (CEIEC). The JN-1601 operates in the HF range of 3–30 MHz. 

The JN-1601 is part of the Chinese JN-Series EW Systems. The JN-Series is an integrated communication countermeasure system designed to search, intercept, monitor, analyze, and jam enemy communication signals. The following are the JN-Series EW platforms: 

JN-1101 Ground Mobile Communications EW complex
JN-1102 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) borne Communications and Radar EW Complex
JN-1105 Portable Communications EW Complex
JN-1601 HF Intercept and Jamming Station 
JN-1602 Heliborne Communications EW Complex
JN-3103 Expendable Jammer
Advanced VHF/UHF Vehicular Communications Countermeasure System

The JN-1601 is capable of operating as a stand-alone platform or as part of an integrated countermeasures system and has secondary roles as a communications relay and as a training aid for EW troops.
