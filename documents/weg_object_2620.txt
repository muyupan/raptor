This document describes the FV103 Spartan British Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

FV103 Spartan is a tracked armored personnel carrier of the British Army. It was developed as the APC variant of the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) family. The vehicle can carry up to seven personnel, including three crew members. Armed with a single machine gun, it is almost indistinguishable from the FV102 Striker in external appearance. Rather than a general personnel carrier for infantry, the Spartan has been used for moving specialist teams, such as anti-aircraft missile teams. An anti-tank variant of the Spartan has been produced, named FV120 Spartan MCT; this is armed with MILAN anti-tank missiles. Nearly 500 Spartans have served with the British armed forces since entering service in 1978; they are now being replaced by newer vehicles.

The FV103 Spartan was developed during the 1970s as the Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) version of the British Army's Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) (CVR(T)) family of armored fighting vehicles, designed by Alvis plc. The vehicle entered service with the British military in 1978. The Spartan is similar in appearance to the FV102 Striker, except for the missile launcher on the Striker.

The Spartan was powered by a 4.2 xk jaguar petrol engine. The vehicle is 5.16 meters (16.9 ft) in length and 2.48 meters (8 ft 2 in) in width. With a ground clearance of 0.33 meters (1 ft 1 in), it has a height of 2.63 meters (8 ft 8 in). As the APC variant of the CVR(T) family, the FV103 has been used by small specialized groups such as mortar fire controller teams, anti-aircraft teams, and also reconnaissance teams. The vehicle can carry seven personnel, in a combination of three crew members and four passengers or two crew members and five passengers.[6] It is armed with one 7.62 mm L37A1 machine gun and can have four smoke dischargers on each side. In addition to the APC role, it has also been used as a resupply vehicle for the FV102 Striker, carrying extra Swingfire missiles. The FV103 has a combat weight of 10,670 kilograms (23,520 lb). It can achieve a maximum speed of 96 kilometers per hour (60 mph) and has a range of 510 kilometers (320 mi). It is capable of negotiating up to 60% of gradients

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Botswana, Iraq, Jordan, Latvia, Nigeria, Oman, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
