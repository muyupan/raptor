This document describes the Victor III-Class (Project 671RTM/RTMK Shchuka Class) Russian Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarine.

Victor III Class (Project 671RTM/RTMK Shchuka Class) Russian Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarine. Soviet designation Project 671RTM/RTMK Shchuka (pike)â€”entered service in 1979; 25 were produced until 1991. Quieter than previous Soviet submarines, these ships had four tubes for launching SS-N-21 or SS-N-15 missiles and Type 53 torpedoes, plus another two tubes for launching SS-N-16 missiles and Type 65 torpedoes. 24 tube-launched weapons or 36 mines could be on board. The Victor III class caused a minor furor in NATO intelligence agencies at its introduction because of the distinctive pod on the vertical stern-plane. Speculation immediately mounted that the pod was the housing for some sort of exotic silent propulsion system, possibly a magnetohydrodynamic drive unit.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
