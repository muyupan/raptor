This document describes the ZBL-09 (Type 09/VN1) Chinese 8x8 Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The ZBL-09 (Type 09) Chinese 8x8 Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)is the latest wheeled platform series to enter service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China. The family was designed by China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and is expected to replace obsolete wheeled vehicles in service with the PLA. The family bears some resemblance to the US Stryker Brigade Combat Team concept and may reflect recent shifts in China's doctrine to mimic the rapidly deployable and mobile formations used by the US and Russia. The ZBL-09 is the most numerous variant of the Type 09 family, which as a result it is often the designation used to describe the entire genus of Type 09 variants. It is designed as an IFV, armed and protected to provide an equipped infantry section with the necessary fire support and shelter needed to effectively influence a battle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Gabon, Nigeria, Thailand, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).
