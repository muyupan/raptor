This document describes the BTR-T Russian Heavy Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The BTR-T  ‘Armoured Transporter–Heavy’) is a Russian heavy infantry combat vehicle, designed by the Design Bureau of Transport Machine-Building (Omsk Transmash) state-run production association.

It is based on the hull of the T-55 tank and answers the need for a heavy, well protected and well armed vehicle adapted to urban combat. The need for a heavy IFV appeared after the First Chechen War during which APCs such as the BTR-80 and BMP-2 suffered heavy losses in urban areas at the hands of Chechen rebels using RPG shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons. As a result, the design incorporates thicker armour, with built-in reactive armour. It also has heavier armament with sufficient elevation to engage targets in multi-story buildings.

The choice of the T-55 hull rather than that of a more modern tank was decided as a cost-cutting measure and also probably in order to validate a conversion solution for the many T-55s in use around the world. It was influenced by Israel's IDF Achzarit that created virtually the same modifications in the 1980s. However, no export contracts have been signed.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
