This document describes the DF-31 (Dongfeng 31) Chinese Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile.

The Dongfeng 31 (DF-31/CSS-10) Chinese Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile is a Chinese intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The three-stage, the solid-fueled missile has an estimated range of 7,000 – 11,700 km. China first deployed the DF-31 in 2006 and has developed two successive variants: the DF-31A and DF-31AG.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Pakistan.

Here is Variants information for the DF-31 (Dongfeng 31) Chinese Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile:
The DF-31A (CSS-10 Mod 2) is In 2007, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army introduced an improved version of the DF-31 called the DF-31A (CSS-10 Mod 2). First tested in 1999, the DF-31A incorporates lightened guidance and other unspecified improvements to extend its range past 11,000 km. The missile is approximately 14 m long and 2 m in diameter. Unlike the DF-31, the missile conceals its warhead beneath a shroud and reportedly employs penetration aids—devices to penetrate missile defenses. These include at least eight decoy warheads. As of 2020, the PLARF reportedly maintains three DF-31A brigades, totaling 36 launchers, in Qinghai, Yunnan, and Henan Provinces..
The DF-31AG is In 2017, China publicly displayed the DF-31AG, a variant of the DF-31A with an upgraded launcher and lower support requirements. Developed by the China Aerospace Science Corporation (CASC) and the Tai’an Special Vehicle Company, the DF-31AG’s wheeled TEL can traverse unpaved terrain. This off-road capability would allow the DF-31AG to disperse to a wider variety of concealed positions, reducing its vulnerability to counterforce attacks. This configuration also requires fewer support vehicles to operate, allowing for increased readiness. As of 2020, the PLARF is known to maintain DF-31AG brigades, totaling 36 launchers, in Lanzhou, Hunan, and Henan Provinces..
