This document describes the BMP-1 Russian Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

Hezbollah Proliferation. Development of the BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle commenced in 1960. It entered service with the Soviet Army in 1966. The BMP-1 was first shown publicly in 1967 and created quite a stir in the West by its apparent combination of mobility protection and gun/missile firepower. This infantry fighting vehicle was produced in large numbers. In its day the BMP-1 was the vehicle that others were measured by and the type was churned out in thousands in the former Soviet Union. It was produced until 1988. Over 20 000 of these IFVs were made. Currently, around 1 000 of these IFVs are in service with the Russian military and Ministry of Internal Affairs. Another 7 000 are in storage. The BMP-1was widely exported to the Soviet allies. It was also produced in China, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. From those four nations sprang a whole host of variants to meet just about every combat requirement from artillery observation to armored engineering vehicle. This IFV has seen combat during many wars. The BMP-1's still remain in service in large numbers. It is estimated that around 7 000 of these armored vehicles are still in service with more than 30 operators, excluding Russia.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, CFE Treaty, Chad, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Iraq, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Non-State Actors, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Uruguay, Viet Nam, Yemen.
