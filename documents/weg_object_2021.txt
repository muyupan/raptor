This document describes the Carl Gustaf M4 (M3-E1) Swedish 84mm Man-Portable Anti-Tank Recoilless Rifle.

At AUSA 2014, Saab Dynamics displayed its new Carl Gustaf M4 variant. Compared to the M3 MAAWS, the M4 is 3.4 kg (7.5 lb) lighter, weighing 6.6 kg (15 lb), and shorter with a 950 mm (37 in) overall length. The shorter length was in response to the need to wield the weapon in urban terrain, and weight savings were achieved through using lighter components whenever possible including a carbon fiber tube with titanium liner, as well as a new venturi design. Other new features include a red-dot sight, a travel safety catch to allow the M4 to be carried while loaded, an adjustable shoulder rest and forward grip for improved ergonomics, a shot counter to keep track of how many rounds have been fired to manage the weapon's 1,000-round barrel life, Picatinny rails for grips and sight mounts, and a remote round management function so intelligent sights can "talk" to programmable rounds.

The US Defense Department agreed to evaluate the shorter and lighter M4 version over the next two years;[16] testing and qualifications were planned to be completed in spring 2017, and the weapon type was classified as the M3E1 in fall 2017, making the system available for procurement to all Department of Defense services. The first unit is planned to be equipped with the M3E1 in 2018.

In April 2019, a contract of SEK168 million (USD18.1 million) was approved to supply the Australian Army with ammunition for the Carl-Gustaf M4 84 mm multipurpose weapon systems ordered by the service in September 2018.

M3 was the name used for decades worldwide for the basic weapon. For the new, improved, lighter, titanium-employing weapon, first displayed in 2014, the name everyone uses is M4, except for the USA. In the US the Army designation for the US version of the improved M4 mentioned above was given the name: M3-E1.

In 2017, the U.S. Army approved a requirement for 1,111 M3E1 units to be fielded to soldiers as part of an Urgent Material Release. The M3E1 is part of the Product Manager Crew Served Weapon portfolio. A key benefit of the M3E1 is that it can fire multiple types of rounds, giving soldiers increased capability on the battlefield. By using titanium, the updated M3E1, based on the M3A1 introduced in 2014, is more than six pounds lighter. The M3E1 is also 2.5 inches shorter and has an improved carrying handle, shoulder padding and an improved sighting system that can be adjusted for better comfort without sacrificing performance. The wiring harness was included in the M3E1 configuration that provides a foregrip controller and programmable fuze setter for an interchangeable fire control system. For added safety and cost savings, an automatic round counter enables Soldiers and logisticians to accurately track the service life of each weapon. The M3E1 uses the same family of ammunition as the M3, which has been successfully tested.

In November 2017, the U.S. Marine Corps announced they planned to procure the M3E1 MAAWS. 1,200 M3E1s would be acquired with one fielded to every infantry squad. In addition to infantry use, the Marines are considering it to replace the Mk 153 SMAW in combat engineer squads. The weapons perform similar functions and the improvements incorporated into the new M3E1 place it in the same size and approximate weight class as the SMAW. While the SMAW weighs 2.5 lb (1.1 kg) less when loaded, the MAAWS has a greater variety of ammunition available and a maximum effective range of 1,000 meters, twice that of the SMAW. The Marines plan to test both weapons' effectiveness against bunkers to inform their decision.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Libya, Lithuania, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Zambia.

Here is Variants information for the Carl Gustaf M4 (M3-E1) Swedish 84mm Man-Portable Anti-Tank Recoilless Rifle:
The M1 (1948) is Original, still in Service with Third-World Countries.
The M2 (1963) is An improved, lighter and slightly shorter version, the Carl Gustaf M2, was introduced in 1964 and quickly replaced the original version..
The M3 (1991) is The current Carl Gustaf M3 version was introduced in 1991. It reduced the weight even further by replacing the forged steel tube with a thin steel liner containing the rifling, strengthened by a carbon fiber outer sleeve. The external steel parts were also replaced with plastics and aluminium alloys. In recent years, the M3 has found new life in a variety of roles. The British Special Air Service, United States Army Special Forces and United States Army Rangers use M3s in bunker-busting and anti-vehicle roles, while the German Bundeswehr maintains a small number of M2s for battlefield illumination. Many armies continue to use it as a viable anti-armor weapon, especially against 1950s- and 1960s-era tanks and other armored vehicles still in use worldwide..
The M3 MAAWS is In November 2011, the U.S. Army began ordering the M3 MAAWS for regular units deployed in Afghanistan. Soldiers were being engaged with RPGs at 900 meters, while their light weapons had effective ranges of 500–600 meters. The Gustaf allows airburst capability of troops in defilade out to 1,250 meters, and high explosive use out to 1,300 meters. While the weapon provides enhanced effectiveness, its 9.5 kg (21 lb) weight burdens troops. On 28 March 2013, USSOCOM announced a call for sources to develop a kit to lighten the M3 MAAWS and reduce overall length without affecting handling or ruggedness. By that time, Saab was developing a weight-reduced version prior to the SOCOM release that demonstrated no decrease in performance, no increase in recoil, and nearly equivalent barrel life that could be ready for government testing in 2014. Saab has also developed a new high explosive round that has a direct fire range of 1,500 meters when using a fire control system.

The US Defense Department agreed to evaluate the shorter and lighter M4 version over the next two years; testing and qualifications were planned to be completed in spring 2017, and the weapon type classified as the M3E1 in fall 2017, making the system available for procurement to all Department of Defense services.
