This document describes the Type SLR-66 Chinese Over-the-Horizon (OTH) Radar.

The Chinese over-the-horizon (OTH) radar is a high frequency (HF) band (NATO A-band) (6–22 MHz) bistatic system, which is used to detect low-altitude penetrating bombers and has early warning ability against intercontinental ballistic missiles and deployed long-range surveillance ships.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
