This document describes the 2S25 Sprut-SD Russian Light Amphibious Tank.

The  2S25 Sprut-SD Russian Light Amphibious Tank is a self-propelled tank destroyer or light tank developed and manufactured by the Volgograd Tractor Plant to meet the requirements of the VDV. In mid-2001, the Volgograd tractor plant revealed that the development of the 2S25 had lasted several years.  The Sprut-SD is designed to defeat tanks, hard-skinned material, and enemy manpower by airborne and amphibious landing forces, as well as by specially designated units of ground forces. Its main armament, the 2A75, is capable of firing APFSDS, HE-Frag, HEAT, and ATGM ammunition. This allows the 2S25 firepower to be as powerful as the main battle tank and as maneuverable and amphibious as airborne infantry combat vehicles. The 2S25 can be used by units of ground forces and naval infantry as a light amphibious tank.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
