This document describes the R-149BMR Russian 8x8 Amphibious Armored Command and Signal Vehicle.

The R-149BMR is a Command and Signal variant of the BTR-80. The R-149BMR is typically used at the Russian equivalent to the United States Army's Brigade and Battalion Level. 


The BTR-80 is an 8×8 wheeled amphibious armoured personnel carrier (APC) designed in the USSR. The BTR-80 is a modern, lightly armored vehicle with a diesel power plant. It is manufactured at the Gorkiy Automobile Factory in  Nizhniy Novgorod and has been in service since the early 1980s. The BTR-80 is a lightly armored amphibious vehicle with a collective chemical-biological-radiological (CBR) protective system. Operated by a crew of three, the vehicle can carry a squad of seven infantry troops. The BTR-80 8 x 8 armored personnel carrier is intended to carry personnel on the battlefield and provide close fire support. It can also carry out reconnaissance, combat support and patrol missions. It entered service with the Russian army in the late 1980's and has since been used in a number of military conflicts, including UN peacekeeping operations. The vehicle is in production and in service with the Russian army and with a number of other countries.The BTR-80 is superior to BTR-60/70 with a larger chassis, high-angle-of- fire turret, and single more powerful diesel engine (vs gasoline). Although the armament is same as BTR-60 and BTR-70, except for added smoke grenade dispensers on the back of the turret, the conical turret has been improved and the gun can elevate higher.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation, Tanzania.
