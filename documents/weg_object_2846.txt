This document describes the 1V16 Russian Amphibious Artillery Command and Reconnaissance Vehicle.

The 1V16 is the simplest of the vehicles in the 1V12 ACRV complex and serves as the battalion FDC / Chief of Staff's vehicle.  Normally, the battalion chief of staff, assisted by fire direction and communication personnel mans the vehicle.  It has neither battlefield observation optics nor a navigation system.  However, the vehicle is equipped with the standard VOP-7 vision blocks and driver's periscopes.  It is equipped with extra radios and has an extendable antenna mast mounted on the vehicle rear.  The 9V59 fire direction computer is mounted in the vehicle.
The 9V59 fire control computer comes in several different models believed to be designated a 9V59-1, -2, and -3.  For example, the 9V59-2 is associated with 152mm artillery units.  The 9V59 fire control computer is probably a 4-bit computer and, although quite rugged, is assessed to have a low mean time between failures because of a larger number of discrete components.  The 1V510 is assessed to be a replacement for the 9V59 fire control computer.  The 1V510 is capable of performing survey calculations and technical firing data.  The system is assessed to be 33% faster than the 9V59.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bulgaria, CFE Treaty, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.
