This document describes the HQ-17A (FM-2000) Chinese Short-Range Air Defense Missile System.

The HQ-17A is a new China's short-range air defense system. It evolved from the HQ-17 (China's copy of the Russian Tor). China imported a total of 35 Tor M1 systems from Russia and offered to co-produce this air defense system in China. However, Russia reportedly refused. Eventually, China copied the Tor M1 and developed its indigenous version - the HQ-17, which featured some improvements, including a modern radar. The HQ-17A is a further development. This could be a good indication of how self-sufficient and advanced is China's weapon industry. The pre-production version of the HQ-17A was first publicly revealed in 2018 in the form of an FM-2000 air defense missile system. Operational HQ-17A systems were first publicly revealed in 2019 during a military parade.

The HQ-17A uses a new wheeled chassis instead of a track. In terms of capabilities, it is broadly similar to the Russian Tor M2 system. Overall it resembles versions of the Tor, based on a Belarusian MZKT-6922 high mobility wheeled chassis. Some components of the HQ-17A, such as the radar, might be actually more advanced than those of the Russian Tor.

The HQ-17A can engage all kinds of modern air targets, including aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, cruise missiles, and precision-guided munitions. Basically, it is intended to destroy targets that long- and medium-range air defense systems failed to hit. The HQ-17A was designed to protect mechanized formations. Though it can be also used to protect important stationary assets, such as military bases, airfields, ports, supply depots, command centers, and so on. For this role, an expensive tracked chassis was not required.

The HQ-17A launcher vehicle carries both radars and missiles. A total of 16 missiles. Missiles are launched vertically. The maximum range of fire is around 15 km. Missiles can reach their targets at an altitude of up to 10 km. Hit probability of a single missile against aircraft is up to around 45-80%.

The HQ-17A uses wheeled chassis with an all-wheel-drive configuration. It seems that this chassis is produced by Dongfeng motor corporation. The vehicle has good cross-country mobility and can travel over difficult terrain. A central tire pressure system is fitted as standard. The cab is lightly armored and provides some degree of protection against small arms fire and shell splinters.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
