This document describes the TM-57 Russian Anti-Tank Mine.

The TM-57 mine is a large, circular Soviet metal-cased blast anti-tank mine. It can either be triggered by pressure or a tilt-rod fuze. Development of the TM-46 mine is found in Africa, the Middle East, and South East Asia.

The TM-57 has a larger main charge and improved fuzing compared to the earlier TM-46. It is circular with a metal case and a central fuze well. A secondary MUV or VPF fuze can be fitted on the side of the mine, which serves as an anti-handling device. The tilt rod fuze gives the mine improved resistance to blast; it is activated when it is forced to a deflection of 25 to 30 degrees. A training version of the mine that produces smoke is designated the TM-60.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Eastern Asia, Middle Africa, Northern Africa, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Southern Africa, Southern Asia, Viet Nam, Western Africa.
