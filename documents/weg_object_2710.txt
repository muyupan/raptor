This document describes the BREM-1 Russian Armored Recovery Vehicle.

BREM-1 Russian Armored Recovery Vehicle was developed to support a fleet of T-72 main battle tanks and their derivatives. Officially it entered service with the Soviet Army in 1975. Other sources report that production commenced in 1984. Until 1990 a total of 342 BREM-1 armored recovery vehicles have been delivered. The Russian Army had no dedicated recovery vehicle for its T-64 and T-80 series tanks. So the BREM-1 was used to support these tanks as well. So 342 units was not much considering that the Soviets were churning out their tanks in tens of thousands. A lack of recovery vehicles was always felt in the Soviet, and later Russian army. Russian Army is still using the aging BTS-4 armored recovery vehicles. The BREM-1 has been exported to a number of countries alongside the T-72 MBT. In some cases, it is used to support other tanks when the operator has no dedicated recovery vehicle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Belarus, CFE Treaty, India, Iraq, Poland, Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Viet Nam.
