This document describes the Armidale Class Australian Patrol Boat.

The Armidale Class Australian Patrol Boat fleet are named after Australian cities and towns with close links with Navy heritage. The Armidale Class was named to coincide with the 60th commemoration of the sinking of the original HMAS Armidale (I).
