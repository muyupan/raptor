This document describes the PLL-01 (WAC-021) Chinese 155mm Towed Howitzer.

The PLL-01 (WAC-021) Chinese 155mm Towed Howitzer is fitted with an auxiliary power unit which is a small air-cooled 77 hp diesel engine. It is installed in a fairing carried atop the front of the carriage. The power unit is used for self-movement once the howitzer is in position. It also assists emplacement and displacement of the howitzer. This feature significantly reduced the stress on the crew. A single crew member can jack the gun in 90 seconds. Also, it takes slightly less time to emplace and displace, compared to conventional towed artillery pieces. 
The PLL-01 uses Extended Range, Full Bore (ERFB) ammunition, which has a much longer range than typical howitzer ammunition thanks to improved aerodynamics. The PLL-01 can also fire all standard NATO 155 mm ammunition.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
