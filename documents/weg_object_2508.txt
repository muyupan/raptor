This document describes the Jackal 2 (MWMIK 2) British 4x4 Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle.

An updated version of the Jackal has been ordered as Jackal 2. The crew has been increased to four and the main armament gun ring moved forward to give it an all round arc of fire. The chassis has been upgraded, allowing the vehicle to carry a greater payload and armor, and providing more strength for protection against roadside bombs. It also has a larger 6.7 l engine, although this does not increase the speed of the vehicle. An initial order for "around 110" vehicles was made in 2009, with final deliveries in February 2010. A further order for 140 of the Jackal 2A was announced on 23 June 2010, which is based on the Jackal 2 platform with a blast protection upgrade.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
