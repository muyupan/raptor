This document describes the JN-1105 Chinese Portable Communications EW Complex.

The Chinese JN-1105A is a mobile electronic warfare system designed for searching, detection, direction-finding, and jamming of HF/VHF/UHF radio frequencies. The prime contractor is China National Electronics Import and Export. Corporation. 

The entire system can be mounted on a vehicle or disassembled and transported by several solders using special frames for employment in remote geographical areas such as mountains and the highlands. It operates in HF (1.6 to 30 MHz), VHF (30 to 100 MHz) and UHF (100 to 500 MHz) frequency bands. 

The JN-1105 is part of the Chinese JN-Series EW Systems. The JN-Series is an integrated communication countermeasure system designed to search, intercept, monitor, analyze, and jam enemy communication signals. The following are the JN-Series EW platforms: 

JN-1101 Ground Mobile Communications EW complex
JN-1102 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) borne Communications and Radar EW Complex
JN-1105 Portable Communications EW Complex
JN-1601 HF Intercept and Jamming Station 
JN-1602 Heliborne Communications EW Complex
JN-3103 Expendable Jammer
Advanced VHF/UHF Vehicular Communications Countermeasure System

Here is Variants information for the JN-1105 Chinese Portable Communications EW Complex:
The JN-1105A is The JN1105A is a vehicle-mounted countermeasures system designed to detect, locate, and jam hostile radio communication signal. It operates in HF (1.6 to 30 MHz), VHF (30 to 100 MHz) and UHF (100 to 500 MHz) bands. The JN1105A can be operated 'on the move' and is de-mountable for use in geographies that are inaccessible to its carrier vehicle..
