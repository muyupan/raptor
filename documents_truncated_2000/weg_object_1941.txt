This document describes the Type 70-1 Chinese 62mm Rocket Launcher.

This is a light antitank weapon intended for one-man use against light and medium armor. It is comprised of a two-part launch tube of fiberglass, with a simple pistol grip and sight. The rear of the launcher is removed for loading; the round is placed inside and the rear section replaced around the rocket. The rocket is very light, and the Chinese use the Type 70-1 more as a bunker buster or antipersonnel weapon than an antiarmor weapon.

The Type 70-1 used a two-piece tube design. The front tube is the launch tube (which could be used multiple times). The rear tube was a single use component (which carries a single rocket). The whole weapon system weighed 3.28kg.  Both tubes were connected and locked by a rotary latch and all made of plastic impregnated fiberglass. Close to the screw coupling, there was an aluminum reinforcement in the inner tube. The ammunition tube was encased with a bakelite cover and rubber sealing ring on both sides. A copper terminal jumper was set the inner side of the rear sealing cover forming a rudimentary safetyâ€“when the rear cover was still on the tube, it worked as a short circuit.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
