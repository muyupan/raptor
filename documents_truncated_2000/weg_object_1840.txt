This document describes the XD-D12B Chinese HF Anti-Jamming Transceiver.

The XD-D12B Chinese HF Anti-Jamming Transceiver can be used for medium/long-distance communication between stationary transceivers. Advanced digital signal processing (DSP) technology and microcomputer control technology is employed to realize the functions of the automatic control communication, automatic select optimum channel, ALE, coded voice, data transmission, picture transmission, burst communication, and frequency-hopping communication Functions: transmitting and receiving the short message, wire remote control, noise reduction, master control and DSP online software loading The transceiver adopts connectors of the units, so it is very easy to be maintained The transceiver also adopts aluminum alloy die casting casing, so it is damp-proof, mold-proof and salt-fog proof.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
