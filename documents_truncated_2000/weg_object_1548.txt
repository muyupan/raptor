This document describes the Ivan Green Class (Project 11711 Class) Russian Landing Ship.

The Ivan Gren class, Russian designation Project 11711, is a class of landing ships that is being built for the Russian Navy. The class was to be composed of two vessels, Ivan Gren and Pyotr Morgunov, but later it was announced that the Russian Navy intends to acquire several more vessels of a modified design.

The vessels of the class have a displacement of 5,000–6,000 tons and are able to carry up to 13 main battle tanks or 36 armored personnel carriers and 300 marines. The first ship of the class, Ivan Gren, was laid down on 23 December 2004. The hull of Ivan Gren was completed by the end of November 2010. On 9 October 2010, a contract to increase work on the vessel was signed. The ship was launched on 18 May 2012 and was scheduled to be delivered to the Russian Navy by 2014. Delivery of Ivan Gren was delayed until 2015 while the second ship of the class, Pyotr Morgunov, was laid down in October 2014. Ivan Gren started its sea trials in June 2016 in the Baltic Sea. According to Russian sources, the delay in the commissioning of the lead ship was due to several design faults that include hull stability and engine problems.

On 3 May 2018, the lead ship of the class, Ivan Gren, successfully completed its sea trials held in the Baltic Sea. The warship's systems and complexes were checked by the state acceptance commission of Russia's Defense Ministry. Ivan Gren was accepted into service on 20 June 2018.

Initially, there were no plans to build more ships following Pyotr Morgunov. However, in December 2018, it was reported by the head of Russia's United Shipbuilding Corporation that Russia plans to order additional two or three modified Ivan Gren-class landing ships. On 9 April 2019, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced two more Project 11711 landing ships will be laid down on 23 April 2019.

On 23 April 2019, two modified Project 11711 landing ships, Vladimir Andreev and Vasily Trushin, were laid down during a ceremony at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad. The two new ships differ with the modified superstructure, increased displacement to 7000-8000 tons, and capability to carry the Kamov Ka-52K carrier-based attack helicopters. Their delivery to the Russian Navy is scheduled for 2023 and 2024, respectively.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

The Note is AK-630M-2 Gun
n 1983, a decision was made to update the design and modify the AK-630 system to include a second gun mounted above the first, which provides 10,000 rpm in total. The AK-630M1-2 "Roy" was roughly the same size and weight allowing installation in existing AK-630 mounts. Though the system proved to be successful, the AK-630M1-2 Roy was not accepted for production due to the maturity of a combined missile and gun system, then designated the 3M87 Kortik, but later called Kashtan. The single example of AK-630M1-2 Roy remains installed on the Project 206.6 class missile boat # P-44.

In July 2007 at IMDS-2007, a modernized version of the AK-630M1-2 was showcased by OAO AK Tulamashzavod under the new name "Duet". Visually "Duet" differs from "Roy" in having a new mount with a stealthy low RCS design compared with the more traditional rounded AK-630 mounts.

In 2012 it was announced that the new Ivan Gren-class landing ship would be armed with the modified AK-630M-2 system. It is also used by the Buyan-M-class missile corvette..
