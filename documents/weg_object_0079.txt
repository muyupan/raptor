This document describes the JY-17A Chinese Ground Surveillance Radar System.

The Chinese JY-17A is a medium-range ground surveillance radar (GSR) that is designed to detect, identify, and locate moving ground targets (including low flying aircraft such as helicopters) at any time of the day regardless of the season, and also in conditions of low visibility (fog, rain, snow, dust, or smoke). It is designed and manufactured by the East China Institute of Electronic Engineering (ECRIEE), Hefei, Anhui Province, China. The GSR is modular designed to facilitate customer needs or requirements. It can be mounted on a variety of vehicles as well as deployed on the ground.

It is a fully coherent, solid-state GSR capable of a low probability of intercept. It features a solid-state transmitter, digital pulse compression, pulse-Doppler filter bank processing, and automatic target detection and tracking.
