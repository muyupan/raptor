This document describes the Lada-Class (Project 677 Class) Russian Diesel-Electric Attack Submarine.

Lada-Class (Project 677 Lada Class) Russian Diesel-Electric Attack Submarine is the new advanced class of diesel-electric attack submarine designed by the Russian Rubin Design Bureau. A program to develop a "fourth generation" diesel-electric submarine, it aimed to produce a highly improved version of Project 636 with a better acoustic signature, new combat systems, and possibly air-independent propulsion.

Project 677 St. Petersburg is a Russian diesel-electric submarine developed in the late 1990s. The submarine is designed for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, defense of naval bases, seashore, and sea lanes, as well as for conducting reconnaissance. The class marks the first usage of a mono-hull design by the Russian navy for an attack submarine since the 1940s.

Displacement is 25% lower than that of its predecessor, the Kilo-class submarine, but its capabilities are greatly enhanced. The top submerged speed is 21 knots (39 km/h), up from 19 knots for the Kilo-class. The class is designed for an endurance of 45 days with a complement of 34.

The submarine is equipped with an automated combat control system Litiy, (eng. Lithium).

A variant designated as the project 1650 Amur-class submarine is offered as an export model.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
