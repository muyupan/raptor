Since the late 1970s a number of 122 mm self-propelled howitzers were developed in China to meet Chinese Army requirements. The PLA required mobile artillery system to provide medium- to long-range indirect fire support for motorized infantry and armored troops and capable of keeping pace with them. However none of them could meet these requirements. The Type 89, also known as the PLZ89, was developed in late 1980s. It was Chinese attempt to develop indigenous self-propelled howitzer with similar capabilities to the Soviet 2S1 Gvosdika. The Type 89 is currently in service with Chinese Army and Marines. Several hundred of these artillery systems were built. Currently these are being replaced by the PLZ-07 and PLZ-07B self-propelled howitzers..
