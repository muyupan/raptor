This document describes the OSV-96 Russian 12.7mm Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle.

OSV-96 (Russian: ОСВ-96) is a Russian heavy semi-automatic sniper rifle chambered for 12.7×108mm.

The rifle is capable of engaging infantry at a distance of up to 1800 meters and can combat material targets at ranges up to 2500 meters. As an effective anti-sniper weapon, OSV-96 keeps the shooter outside of the effective range of conventional calibers providing a distinct advantage over lower caliber rifles. Specialized high-accuracy 12.7×108mm 7N34 59.0-gram FMJ and AP sniper cartridges have been developed for Russian .50-caliber sniper rifles such as this rifle. Large caliber machine gun cartridges can also be used for firing, but with limited accuracy. The OSV-96 folds in half in between the barrel/chamber and receiver compartments to shorten its length for ease of transportation. The rifle features a free-floating barrel in combination with a large muzzle brake to greatly decrease its recoil.

The OSV-96 12.7mm sniper rifle began its life during the early 1990s as V-94. Designed and developed at the famous KBP (Instrument Design Bureau) in Tula. During the following years, the rifle incorporated several improvements and was eventually redesignated as OSV-96. It is offered for export and local buyers and is in use by the Russian Army and Internal Affairs Ministry (MVD) special units. 

 

The OSV-96 is a gas-operated, rotating bolt semiautomatic rifle. The bolt locks directly to the barrel extension, so it is possible to make a hinge between the barrel and the receiver. When not in use, the OSV-96 could be "folded" around this hinge to save space, since the rifle is quite long. This feature also allows for quick transformation from folded into battle-ready positions. To 'fold up' the rifle user must lock the bolt back by cocking it and engaging the bolt catch, then release a large barrel lock on the left side of the receiver. The long barrel is free-floated and fitted with a long combination muzzle brake–flash hider. The integral folding bipods are mounted on the special console, attached to the base of the barrel, next to the hinge point. The polymer buttstock is fitted with a rubber recoil pad. OSV-96 is usually fitted with some sort of telescope or night vision sight but also carries a set of backup iron sights.

The exact accuracy data of the OSV-96 is not yet published, but, apparently, it is enough for intended work as an anti-materiel rifle or mid-range counter-sniper rifle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belarus, Egypt, India, Iraq, Russian Federation, Syria, Viet Nam.
