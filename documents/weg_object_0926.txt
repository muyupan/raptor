This document describes the AH-1W Super Cobra American Attack Helicopter.

The AH-1W, the backbone of the United States Marine Corps. Marines have been flying the AH-1W Super Cobra since 1986. The last AH-1W was delivered in 1998. AH-1Ws are fielded in Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons or HMLAs. Detachments from HMLAs deploy as part of the task-organized Aviation Combat Element of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force, the most common of which is the Marine Expeditionary Unit, or MEU.

The Super Cobra was the first attack helicopter to qualify both the Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the Sidearm anti-radiation missile. Both missiles can use the same LAU-7 rail launcher. Sidearm has a range of more than 15km. AIM-9L Sidewinder is an all-aspect, short-range, air-to-air missile produced by Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. The missile has a range of 15km.

A major upgrade of the Bell Super Cobra known as the H-1 program is underway. The program calls for the re-manufacture of the US Marine Corps fleet of 180 AH-1W Super Cobra and 100 UH-1N utility helicopters to an advanced four-bladed configuration, which will operate beyond 2020.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, China, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Taiwan, Turkey, United States of America.
