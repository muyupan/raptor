This document describes the M1296 (Stryker) American Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD).

The M1296 Dragoon (ICVD) is part of a family of eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicles known as Strykers. It has 4-wheel drive (8×4) and can be switched to all-wheel drive (8×8).The Dragoon is the first variant of the Stryker family to be equipped as an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV). Modifications were made to the hull roof of the Stryker in order to install a Kongsberg unmanned turret with an Mk.44 Bushmaster II 30 mm cannon. This added around two tons of weight to the vehicle. The new cannon has significantly increased lethality, range and accuracy over the previous M2 heavy machine gun.
