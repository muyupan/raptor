This document describes the MANTAS T12 American Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV).

The Man-Portable Tactical Autonomous Systems (MANTAS) T12 American Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) was launched in January 2018 at the Surface Navy Association’s (SNA) 2018 National Symposium held in Washington DC, US. The MANTAS T-12 possesses advanced capabilities compared to its predecessors. It is intended to serve the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions of the naval forces.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America.
