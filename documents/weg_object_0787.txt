This document describes the Mohajer-6 Iranian ISTAR Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The Qods Mohajer-6 is an Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) UAV capable of carrying a multispectral surveillance payload and/or up to two precision-guided munitions. Ten have been manufactured as of February 2018 for the IRGC Ground Forces, and 40 are planned for the IRGC Navy. The Mohajer-6 complements the larger Shahid 129 operated by the third IRGC branch, the IRGC-ASF. Three have also been delivered to the Iranian Army.

The Mohajer-6 was unveiled in April 2017 and entered serial production in February 2018. As with other members of the Mohajer family, the Mohajer-6 is made of composite.

The Mohajer-6 has a rectangular fuselage, an upwards-sloping nose, twin tail booms, a top-mounted horizontal stabilizer, unwanted wingtips, straight wings mounted high and to the rear of the body, and air intakes on the top and bottom of the engine. The Mohajer-6 is controlled by two elevators on the horizontal stabilizer, rudders on the vertical stabilizers, and two flaps per wing. Unlike other Mohajer variants, it has a three-bladed propeller. The Mohajer-6 has a wingspan of 10 meters and is 5.67 meters long. It is similar in shape to the Selex ES Falco.

The Mohajer-6 has fixed tricycle landing gear, which underwent changes between the unveiling ceremony in 2017 and mass production in 2018, perhaps to accommodate more weight. It is launched and recovered via runway takeoff/landing.

It has a fixed, forward-facing camera for navigation and a gimbal on the chin for a laser range finder and multispectral IR and visible light electro-optical imagery. The Mohajer-6 has three antennas, two on its left-wing and one on its right, and a pitot tube on its nose. The Mohajer-6 has two hardpoints, one under each wing, which can each carry one Qaem TV/IR-guided missile. It has an autopilot system capable of automatic takeoff and landing. In addition, Iran describes it as capable of being fitted with electronic support measures, communications jamming, or electronic warfare payloads.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Ethiopia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the Mohajer-6 Iranian ISTAR Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV):
The Mohajer-1 is The Mohajer was Iran's first drone to enter series production and was used during the Iranâ€“Iraq War. The Mohajer-1 was known simply as "Mohajer" through the 80s and 90s, when it was re-designated "Mohajer-1" as other Mohajer variants had been developed..
The Mohajer-2 is Following the successful use of the Mohajer-1, Iran wanted a version with more range and endurance. This version, which would later be named the Mohajer-2, also had an autopilot system to fly beyond the line of control of its command center..
The Mohajer-2N is In 2014, Iran introduced the Mohajer-2N, which shares the same design as the Mohajer-2 but has far improved performance. The Mohajer-2N replaces the electronics of the Mohajer-2 with more modern versions and has also improved flight characteristics..
The Mohajer-3 is The Mohajer-3, also known as the Dorna, was designed with a new airframe for better performance. It had a square body and featured a low-mounted horizontal stabilizer flush with the main wing, the only member of the Mohajer family configured this way..
The Mohajer-4 is The Mohajer-4 was designed for both the Iranian Army and the IRGC and entered service in late 1997..
The Mohajer-4B is Also known as the Sadiq, the Mohajer-4B is a significant evolution of the Mohajer-4 platform with a square fuselage, twin tail booms, a top-mounted horizontal stabilizer, unwanted wingtips, new landing skids, and straight wings mounted high and to the mid of the body..
The Sadegh-1 is The Sadegh-1 ("Honest-1"), also known as the QOM-1, is simply a Mohajer-4B with two MANPADS mounted on pylons. It was tested in late 2014..
The Mohajer-6 is The Qods Mohajer-6 is a persistent ISTAR UAV capable of carrying a multispectral surveillance payload and/or up to two precision-guided munitions. Ten have been manufactured as of February 2018 for the IRGC Ground Forces, and 40 are planned for the IRGC Navy. The Mohajer-6 complements the larger Shahid 129 operated by the third IRGC branch, the IRGC-ASF. Three have also been delivered to the Iranian Army..
