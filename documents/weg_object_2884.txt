This document describes the M997A3 HMMWV American 4x4 Ambulance.

Rugged and resilient, the M997A3 is an ambulance configuration of the Humvee family. Equipped with advanced armor protection, these combat ambulances were built to reliably transport causalities from the battlefield to medical aid stations.

Capable of transporting up to four litter patients, eight ambulatory patients—or a combination of both—as well as medical personnel, equipment and a driver, the M997A3 is dependable in the face of danger.

The ambulance can be heated, ventilated or air conditioned, depending on environmental conditions. For operation in a nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) environment, the M977A3 can be equipped with a Gas-Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU) with heaters capable of supporting up to seven personnel equipped with either M25 series protective masks or M13 series patient-protective masks. The GPFU sends temperature-controlled, filtered air to individual face masks, increasing protection, making breathing easier and reducing stress and heat fatigue during extended periods of NBC operation.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chile, Colombia, Djibouti, Ecuador, Greece, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Mexico, Morocco, Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sudan, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates.
