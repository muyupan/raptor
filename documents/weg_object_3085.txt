This document describes the T-72A Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The T-72A is the second generation of Soviet-made main battle tank MBT in the T-72 family. The first version of the T-72 entered production in 1970. It is a further development of the T-62 with some features of the T-64A (upgraded version of basic T-64) and has been further developed as the T-90. The T-72A was accepted for service with the Russian army in June 1979 and is a further development of the standard MBT T-72. The T-72 was the most common tank used by the Soviet Army from the 1970s to the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was also exported to other Warsaw Pact countries, as well as Finland, India, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yugoslavia, as well as being copied elsewhere, both with and without licenses.

In 1979, the T-72A received a laser rangefinder and electronic fire control. In addition, the turret front and the top were reinforced with composite armor (nicknamed Dolly Parton by US intelligence), and space modifications were made to mount reactive armor, smoke grenade launchers, flipper armor mount on front mudguards, and crew compartment changes.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Russian Federation, Ukraine.

Here is Variants information for the T-72A Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The T-72B is Second Russian main variant of the T-72 after the T-72A..
The T-72B1 is In 1986, a limited production variant without an ATGM launch capability. Some do not have ERA..
The T-72BK is The Commander's variant with additional radios..
The T-72BM is Russian T-72B upgrade with 2nd gen ERA. The system is fielded, available for export, and upgraded. Tier 2 and some Tier 3 tanks can challenge US forces under favorable conditions when using modern ammunition and employed by well-trained units with sound tactics. A variety of upgrades are available for the T-72B. They include protection upgrades, such as improved ERA, APS, defensive aids suites with IR jammers, plate armor, welded turret, and grill armor around tracks and grill. Mobility upgrades include a new power train, improved steering, improved mine plows, and rollers, and an electronic mine spoofing system. Fire control system upgrades include new sights, guns, ammunition, and improved stabilization. With the expanding number of upgrades offered by former Warsaw Pact, Asian, Israeli, and other firms, most T-72-type tanks have some level of upgrade from the basic T-72 MBT. The more affordable upgrade approach for most countries is to execute specific upgrades during maintenance work. But this approach may result in only partially modernized tanks at any one point in the life of the vehicle, and which are not as modern as more recent competitors. An alternative is to produce modernized tanks in small numbers, resulting in high per-unit production costs..
The T-72BU is Upgrade variant with the fire control system from the T-80U as well as well as a variety of other changes..
The T-72BU renamed T-90 is With the limited market for new tanks, the world tank industry has developed upgrades and whole vehicle upgrade packages to tap into the market. Older T-72 tanks can be brought up to the T-72B standard. Some approach the T-90 standard. Most T-72-type tanks fielded reflect some level of upgrade. Upgrade options are expanding from former Warsaw Pact, Asian, Israeli, and other international firms..
The T-72S / Shilden is Russian export T-72A upgraded to the T-72B standard. Although visually similar to T-72B, it has slightly less chassis and turret protection. Former Warsaw Pact countries such as Slovakia and Middle Eastern countries like Iran have upgraded their tanks to the T-72S standard..
The M-84AB1 is Yugoslav upgrade to the M-84, bringing it close to the T-90, and the latest T-72B improved tanks..
The M-95 Degman is Croatian M-84 upgrade with box composite armor, ERA, 1200hp, and thermal FCS. An export upgrade conversion, AKA M-84D, is offered for Kuwaiti M-84A tanks..
The PT-91 is Polish upgrade tanks with ERA, Drawa improved FCS, Savan-5 thermal sight, improved gun stabilization, and countermeasures..
The PT-91M is Has a 1000hp engine, new guns and FCS, armor changes, and other improvements. PT-91M exported to Singapore. PT-91P is designed for export to Peru..
The T-72M1 is Demonstrator with 2nd generation ERA and other upgrades were displayed at military shows..
The T-72M1M is Includes 3rd generation Relikt ERA and optional Arena Active Protection System (APS). Alternative designations: Rogata and SMT M1988. It is almost the same as the T-72S (Export), except for more ERA on the side skirts..
