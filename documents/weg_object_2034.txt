This document describes the K5 (M65) Israeli 120mm Mortar.

The M-65 is a 120 mm mortar that was developed by Tampella in 1953 via introduction of new baseplate for 120 Krh/40 invented by Hans Otto Donner. In the 1960s Soltam Systems of Israel bought a license. The mortar system comes in two versions, a standard mortar, and a long-range version.

This heavy mortar is light enough to be transported by helicopter sling load, drop by parachute, or carried in an APC such as the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier. It can also be towed as a normal artillery piece or even manhandled if necessary. The wheels on the carriage are the same as fitted to the M151 Jeep and have handling rings to aid in manhandling it. All components are made of chrome-plated or stainless steel to resist wear and corrosion.
