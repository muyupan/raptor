This document describes the PGZ-95 (Type 95) Chinese 25mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Vehicle.

The Type 95 (PGZ-95) Chinese 25mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Vehicle was designed by the Northwest Institute of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering for Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Ground Force (PLAGF).

The PGZ95 was first demonstrated in 1999 during a military parade in Beijing. It was offered to overseas customers by the state-owned enterprise China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO), but no orders were received. Development of the PGZ95 commenced in the mid-1980s. The system was developed as a Chinese equivalent of the Russian ZSU-23-4M4 Shilka.

PGZ95 is believed to have been benefited from the Italian Sidam 25mm SPAAG system as China acquired a Sidam turret in the mid-1980s for evaluation. The Type 95 is more capable than the former Chinese SPAAG systems. The 25mm cannon of the vehicle was based on the Type 87 25mm towed anti-aircraft gun. The hull is mounted on a tracked armored chassis. The vehicle can accommodate a driver, a commander, and a gunner. The commander is seated behind the driver who sits on the left side of the vehicle.

Both are provided with a raised hatch and three vision blocks. The engine is located forward of the vehicle, while a one-man turret is fitted on the rear of the hull. A typical Type 95 battery consists of six SPAAA vehicles and a single command vehicle. Additionally, three ammunition re-supply trucks, a test/repair truck, and a power supply truck support each battery.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
