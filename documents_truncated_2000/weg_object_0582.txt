This document describes the SLWH Pegasus Singapore 155mm Towed Howitzer.

The Singaporean Light Weight Howitzer is a 155-mm 39 caliber towed howitzer. It is commonly referred to as Pegasus. Introduced in 2005, Pegasus weighs approximately 5.4 tons and is transportable by a CH-47 helicopter or it can be transported by a C-130 Hercules aircraft. It has a recoil management design that reduces the recoil by approximately one third. The Pegasus uses a a firing platform base rather than a split trail carriage to decrease the times for emplacement and displacement.

Pegasus has the ability to self-traverse short distances (when minor firing position changes are required) at a maximum speed of 12 km/h via an onboard diesel engine

The Pegasus is equipped with an onboard Lombardini 9LD625-2 air cooled diesel engine auxiliary power unit (APU) delivering a power output of 21kW. The APU provides power for self traverse over short distances and an ammunition loading system that facilitates automatic loading and reduces crew fatigue.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Singapore.
