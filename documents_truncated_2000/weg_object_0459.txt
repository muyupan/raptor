This document describes the BM-24 (Katyusha) Russian 240mm Multiple Rocket Launcher.

The BM-24 is a multiple rocket launcher designed in the Soviet Union. It is capable of launching 240mm rockets from 12 launch tubes. Versions of the BM-24 have been mounted on the ZIL-151 6x6 Truck chassis and the AT-S tracked artillery tractor, forming the BM-24T from the latter. Production began out of Automotive Factory no. 2 in 1947 Moscow. Israel operated one battalion, consisting of vehicles captured from Egypt in the Six-Day War. The battalion took part in the Yom Kippur War and the 1982 Lebanon War.

The Soviet Army was equipped with BM-24 after WWII. The BM-24 multiple launch rocket system fired the powerful M-24F 240mm rockets, each carrying 27,4 kg of the explosive. In addition to the M-24F, the system could also fire the M-24FUD, having the lighter 18,4 kg shell, but with a longer 10600m range. The MS-24 and MS-24D, loaded with P-35 poison-gas, were also available. The system had 12 launch tubes located on a rotary frame, disposed on a stub pole at the vehicle rear. The lining and turning mechanisms were hand-driven. The cabin and fuel tanks were protected from rocket exhaust by steel skin plates. Two jacks were set against the soil before shooting to discharge the back axles springs and to stabilize the platform. The 95 hp engine permitted the BM-24 to reach a speed of 55km/h on the highway and to have a range of up to 600 km.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Angola, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Yemen.
