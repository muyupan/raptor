It has a maximum range of 600 – 900 km and can deliver a 500 – 750 kg payload, with conventional warheads optimized for a precision strike, bunker-busting, and anti-runway operations. It is capable of striking Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, and northern India from mainland China.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the DF-15 (Dongfeng 15) Chinese Short-Range Ballistic Missile:
The DF-15A is At 10m, the DF-15A is slightly longer than the DF-15, and it also has a rounded nose shape.  This variant is also more accurate at 30 m to 45 m CEP due to sectored control fins at the rear of the missile, GPS updates and a radar terminal correlation system, and flip-out control fins on the re-entry vehicle (RV).  The payload is reportedly 600 kg and a 2009 report indicated that its maximum range is 900 km..
The DF-15B is This missile was first revealed publicly during an October 2009 military parade in Beijing.  Similar to the DF-15A, the DF-15B has components that reportedly increase the accuracy including four stabilizing fins, improved terminal guidance, and an active radar seeker and laser range finder.  The accuracy is estimated to be 5m to 10 m CEP.  Its range is reported to be between 50 km and 800 km depending on the payload..
The DF-15C is An unconfirmed report in 2007 claimed that the PRC is developing a third variant of the missile designed to strike hardened underground facilities.  This bunker buster will host a deep-penetration warhead and is likely designed to attack hardened underground military targets in Taiwan..
