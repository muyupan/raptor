This document describes the Searcher Mk II Israeli Reconnaissance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The Searcher is a multi-mission tactical Unmanned Air System (UAS) used for surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition, artillery adjustment, and damage assessment and developed by IAI in the 1990s. It was designed to meet present and future requirements for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in support of the Israel Air Force as well as export customers. The air vehicle design provides excellent engine and aerodynamics performance and handling qualities while the ground control station was designed to provide compatibility with other UAV systems produced by Israel. So far the Searcher family includes the Mk I, Mk II, and Mk III models.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Israel, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand.
