This document describes the 2B25 Gaul Russian 82mm Light Mortar.

The 2B25 Gaul mortar is used to engage the enemy troops situated both in the open and in uncovered field entrenchments and is effective against personnel wearing individual armor.
2B25 can deliver indirect fire against visible and nonobservable targets from various types of ground both in the day and night time, at ambient temperatures -50 to +50 °С.

The unique design of the 2B25 mortar and its 3VO35 bomb provides the advantage of concealed operation. The mortar fire attack is not expected by the enemy because of the mortar's low acoustic signature, and absence of flash and smoke.
2B25 mortar can be transferred from combat to traveling position and vice versa without its disassembling into parts. For short distances, it is carried with the help of straps attached to the mortar. For large distances, the mortar may be transported in a standard box by any means of transportation or by the crew in a rucksack. Due to its small size and weight, 2B25 mortar can easily be carried by one soldier.
All these advantages make the mortar attractive for Special Forces, especially in counter-terrorism operations.
