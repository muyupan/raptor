This document describes the Type 927 Class (Dongjian Class) Chinese Acoustic Surveillance Ship.

The Type 927 Class (Dongjian Class) Chinese Acoustic Surveillance Ship features a SWATH catamaran design. This
reduces their waterline and provides stability and maneuverability on the water, including in rough
seas and at the slow speeds used during long-range towed-sonar operations.

In peacetime, these ships use their towed array sonar to collect acoustic data on foreign submarines and track their movements within and beyond the first island chain. In wartime, Type 927 vessels could contribute to PLAN anti-submarine warfare operations in support of a range of different maritime campaigns. However, their lack of self-defense capabilities would make them extremely vulnerable to attack.



This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
