This document describes the POM-2S Russian Anti-Personnel Mine.

The Russian POM-2S is a scatterable, anti-personnel, fragmentation landmine.

It has a cylindrical cast-steel body with tripwire dispensers and a central fuzing system.

Surrounding the fuzing system is the main charge of TNT.

Once dispensed from the delivery system, the landmine is armed and various components are ejected.

After landing six spring-loaded metal fins bring the landmine into an upright position.

After a few seconds, the top is blown off allowing the release of 4 spring-loaded spools of plastic tripwire.

The tripwires are attached to an arm of the striker release mechanism.

Tripping a wire rotates the arm and the spring-loaded striker releases onto the central stab-sensitive detonator assembly.

Only 300g of force is required to release the mechanism.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
