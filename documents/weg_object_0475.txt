This document describes the Type 79 Chinese 305mm Anti-Tank Mine Laying Multiple Rocket Launcher.

The Type 79 mine-laying rocket system, consisted of a tubular, welded steel launcher assembly frame mounted on the bed of a CA-30A 6 x 6 truck.  The eight-round launcher could traverse 95 degrees left and 45 degrees right, with an elevation ranging from +4 degrees to +50 degrees.  The sighting system was located on the left side of the launcher. Each rocket shell carried 10 Type 69 plastic anti-tank mines. A typical battery of four launchers was capable of laying down a minefield measuring 650m x 350m.
Production of the missile and truck chassis has been completed. The missile production was started by Norinco, but finished by another company, presumably Chinese.
The system is no longer reported in service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
