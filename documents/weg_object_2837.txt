This document describes the UM600 Norwegian Vehicle-Mounted UHF IP Broadband Radio.

The UM600 high capacity UHF radio supports tactical operations in mobile platforms. High data throughput is ensures with a transmission range suited for vehicles at the tactical edge of an operation.
UM600 has full router functionality including multi-hop features ensuring that data is reaching its destination correct and timely.

UM600 can support up to 2.5 Mbit/s. For harsh operational environment the radio is optimized at a data rate of 900 kbit/s. UM600 can be configured to operate in a mixed TDMA mode supporting a number of voice channels as well as guaranteed access for time critical data. This mode is the optimum choice for handling all communication needs within e.g. an 8x8 Company.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Norway.
