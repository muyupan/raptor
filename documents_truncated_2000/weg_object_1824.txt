This document describes the Flexnet French Wireless Protection and Surveillance Platform.

Flexnet is a modular sensor solution offering strength protection and monitoring of critical sites. Developed by Exensor, Flexnet combines a comprehensive toolbox of sensors for Military and Homeland protection applications.

Launched in 2008, the Flexnet solution is a flexible and user-friendly, comprehensive surveillance solution composed of a portfolio of intelligent, wireless Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) and cameras allowing the detection, classification, identification and tracking of moving objects on the ground.

Ensuring a full 360° 24/7 perimeter protection for all kinds of security operations, the Flexnet solution is one of the most reliable sensor solutions available on the market. Thanks to its flexible toolbox architecture, the solution can easily be extended by integrating external sensors for multi-surveillance missions. Suited for harsh environmental conditions, the Flexnet wireless platform is adapted for military force protection, area surveillance as well as intelligence gathering.

The Flexnet solution, developed by Exensor, is a user-friendly, flexible, comprehensive surveillance solution combining a wide range of sensors (passive infrared, seismic and acoustic, and intelligent motion cameras) with a proprietary command & control software. This self-healing Mesh network allows for detection, classification & identification of any threat. The Flexnet sensor platform is a Force Multiplier that can be used for several applications, ranging from force protection tasks, such as airbase protection, camp protection, patrol and self-protection tasks, to Intelligence Gathering, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISTAR) tasks.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: France, United States of America.
