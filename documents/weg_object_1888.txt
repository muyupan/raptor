This document describes the 9M14 Malyutka (AT-3 Sagger) Russian Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM).

HEZBOLLAH Proliferation. The 9M14 Malyutka (AT-3 Sagger) Russian Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) is a Russian-made wire-guided anti-tank missile equipped with a shaped-charge high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. The AT-3 Sagger is suitable for integration into helicopters such as Mi-2, Mi-8, and Mi-24. It can be integrated into armored vehicles such as BRDM, BMD, and BMP. 9M14 was also available as a man-transportable anti-tank weapons system. Called Malatyuka during the Soviet Union period, it was first seen in a Moscow parade in May 1965. Since then it has been seen on BRDM wheeled armored vehicles, BMP, and BMD armored infantry fighting vehicles. The Mi-24 helicopter can also carry this missile on its four outboard launchers. Over 200,000 systems have been built and the simplicity of its design and overall effectiveness has triggered its unlicensed reverse engineering in numerous countries: by China as the Red Arrow 73 and Improved Red Arrow 73C with Semi-Automatic Command-to-Line of Sight (SACLOS) guidance, Iran (Raad and its Improved Raad version with probe), North Korea and Taiwan (as the Kuen Wu-1 with a more rounded warhead section).

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, China, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Mali, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Non-State Actors, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Peru, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, South Sudan, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia.
