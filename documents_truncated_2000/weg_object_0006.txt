This document describes the T-90K Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The T-90K Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT) is the commander's version of the T-90, with additional communication (station R-163-50K) and navigation equipment (TNA-4-3). Distinguishing features
As a command vehicle, the T-90K carries different communications systems to the standard T-90. This can assist in distinguishing the vehicle as it will carry additional antennae on the roof of the turret. However, the T-90K will generally be almost identical to the T-90 to avoid the easy location and targeting of command vehicles. Armament
The weapons carried are identical to the T-90, but the additional command equipment limits the space for stored ammunition to 34 rounds instead of 42 rounds in the standard version. Earlier Russian command vehicles, such as the T-80K, also lost the ability to fire the gun-launched guided missile. It is unclear if this effect is carried on with the T-90K but could be a possibility.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, India, Iraq, Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the T-90K Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The T-90A is Russian army version with welded turret, V-92S2 engine and ESSA thermal viewer. Sometimes called T-90 Vladimir, in honor of its chief designer Vladimir Potkin.
The T-90AK is Command version of T-90A..

Tanks will receive 2А82-1М gun (same as in T-14) and fire control system Kalina. They will be upgraded with Afghanit APS and Relikt ERA. The upgrades are also aimed at improving network-centric warfare capabilities and coordination with Armata project vehicles. The first contract was signed in 2017 and serial production started in 2018..
The T-90S is Export version of the T-90, later adopted by the Russian Armed Forces as the T-90A. These tanks were made by Uralvagonzavod and were updated with 1,000 hp (750 kW) engines made by Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. These tanks carry a leaner version of the Shtora-1 passive/active protection system which lacks the infra-red dazzlers carried on the turret. Sometimes called T-90C (Cyrillic letter es looks like a Latin c). These were initially supplied with cast turrets of the early T-90, and when stocks were depleted, new, welded turrets were fabricated..

The T-90MS is ready for serial production.[88] 4 video cameras provide a 360° view of the environment, while the tank is more connected to command. The T-90MS has an upgraded thermal imager that can detect tanks over 3300 meters away..
The BREM-1M is Armoured recovery vehicle..
