This document describes the Su-30 (Flanker-C) Russian Multirole Fighter Aircraft.

The Su-30 (Flanker-C) Russian Multirole Fighter Aircraft is a twin-engine, two-seat supermaneuverable fighter aircraft developed in the Soviet Union by Russia's Sukhoi Aviation Corporation. It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, air-to-air, and air-to-surface deep interdiction missions.

The Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the Sukhoi Su-27 family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the Su-27, Su-30, Su-33, Su-34, and Su-35 have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry. The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organizations: KnAAPO and the Irkut Corporation, both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Belarus, CFE Treaty, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Russian Federation, Uganda, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam.
