This document describes the KS-30 Russian 130mm Towed Anti-Aircraft Gun.

The Soviet 130mm antiaircraft gun KS-30 appeared in the early 1950s. Closely resembling the United States wartime 120mm antiaircraft gun, the KS-30 was used for the home defense forces of the USSR and some other Warsaw Pact countries. It is held in war reserve since it has been replaced by surface-to-air guided missiles. Recognition features are the heavy dual-tire carriage, a firing platform that folds up to a 45-degree angle when the piece is in travel, and the long clean tube without a muzzle brake. The breechblock is of the semiautomatic horizontal sliding wedge type, and the piece is fitted with a power rammer and an automatic fuze setter. Fire control is provided by the PUAZO-30 director and the SON-30 radar. The ammunition is of the fixed-charge, separated type. It is not interchangeable with that of the 130mm field of coastal guns.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Russian Federation, Viet Nam.
