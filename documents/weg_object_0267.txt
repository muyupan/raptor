This document describes the Kh-55 (AS-15 Kent) Russian Long-Range Cruise Missile.

The Kh-55 (Russian: Х-55, also known as RKV-500; NATO reporting name: AS-15 'Kent') is a Soviet/Russian subsonic air-launched cruise missile, designed by MKB Raduga. It has a range of up to 2,500 km (1,350 nmi) and can carry nuclear warheads. Kh-55 is launched exclusively from bomber aircraft.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the Kh-55 (AS-15 Kent) Russian Long-Range Cruise Missile:
The Kh-555 is A conventional variant of the Kh-55. The nuclear warhead has been replaced by a 400 kg unitary HE, penetration HE, or submunitions warhead. Other notable changes include the following: Larger conformal fuel tanks (compared to the Kh-55SM), reduced radar cross-section, improved accuracy, increased range, and 3,500 km..
The Kh-65SE and Kh-SD is The Kh-65SE is a conventional version designed for export, although no exports have been documented. It is capable of carrying a 410kg HE warhead 600km. 1995, a similar missile called the Kh-SD was reported. This missile would have fallen within the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime due to its reduced range of 300km. Although, in 1999 the range was reportedly increased to 600km. Its exact status is unknown..
The Kh-55SM is An extended range version. To achieve the extra range, conformal fuel tanks are mounted on both sides of the fuselage. It also has a more powerful engine, producing 450 kg of thrust. Other differences include a slightly larger body diameter due to the fuel tanks, 0.77 m, an increased launch weight, 1,500 kg, and increased range, 3,000 km..
The Kh-55OK is Version with optical guidance..
The Kh-BD is A future cruise missile with a range of 3 000 km, or greater. In 2017 this missile was at the project stage. It is planned with conventional and nuclear warheads. It should be carried by modernized Tu-160M2 bombers..
The Soumar is Soumar is an unlicensed Iranian copy of the Kh-55. Unlike the original Kh-55, the Soumar is ground-launched. In 2001 Ukraine sold twelve Kh-55 missiles without nuclear warheads to Iran. The existence of the Soumar missile was revealed in 2015..
The Meshkat / Hoveizeh is Meshkat / Hoveizeh is a more recent Iranian missile based on the Kh-55, which is believed to have a range of 1,200km, an increased range over the Soumar.  According to one source, the Iranians are having a difficult time developing a warhead for the cruise missile..
The CJ-10 is CJ-10 is a Chinese land-attack cruise missile, which is believed to be based on the Kh-55 technology. In 1995 production unit of the Kh-55 missiles was delivered to Shanghai and appears to have been used to produce similar cruise missiles in China. Other sources suggest that in 2000 Ukraine exported six Kh-55SM missiles to China..
