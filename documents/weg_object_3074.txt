This document describes the T-84 Oplot Ukrainian Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The T-84 Oplot is an improved version of the Ukrainian T-84 main battle tank and features a new turret. In terms of firepower and protection, the T-84 Oplot is very similar to Russia's T-90 MBT. The Oplot was officially adopted in 2000 with only ten tanks produced in 2001. The Ukrainian Army never ordered this tank in large numbers due to funding problems and the long-standing reliance on the aging T-64 main battle tank and associated variants. Currently, Ukraine's improved version, the Oplot-M, is in production for future small quantity deliveries to Thailand.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Thailand, Ukraine.

Here is Variants information for the T-84 Oplot Ukrainian Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The T-80 (1976) is Initial model, with 1,000-hp gas turbine engine, coincidence rangefinder, and no missile capability. This model does not have fittings for explosive reactive armour. The turret is from the T-64A, and thus retains the use of the old coincidence rangefinder. Characteristics of this type are the V shaped water deflector on the front glacis, coincidence rangefinder in front of the commander's cupola, and Luna searchlight mounted in the same position as a T-64. Around 250 were produced, as the tank's armour was essentially obsolete when introduced. Turret vs APFSDS – 380 mm, hull vs APFSDS – 500 mm (without reactive armour). This was, in effect, a pre-production model. It reportedly was fitted with an early version of the Shtora APS..
The T-80B (1978) is This model had a new turret, laser rangefinder, fire-control, and autoloader allowing the firing of a 9M112-1 Kobra antitank guided missile (80% hit probability while stopped and on the move), and improved composite armor. An improved, 1,100-hp, engine was added in 1980, a new gun in 1982, and fittings for reactive armor in 1985. Reactive armor added protection of 400 mm equivalent armor to defend against HEAT warheads. The longest sighting range for T-80B kinetic energy ammunition and for "cumulative" ammunition – is 4,000 m, high-explosive fragmentation – is 5,000 m (using the "side level" – 10,000 m). A night sight TPNZ-49 in active mode reached 1,300 and a passive – 850 m. "Reflex" guided missile complex with laser beam allowed it to launch missiles at any tank speed..
The T-80BV (1985) is T-80B with explosive reactive armor Kontakt-1..
The T-80UM is Russian version, with new Buran thermal imaging sight in place of the Luna IR..
The Object 219A: Early T-80U (Object 219AS) variant is It has the T-80U's turret, but not the Kontakt-5 ERA. Instead, it uses the old Kontakt-1/3 system; some 219As did not have ERA at all. Often misnamed T-80A.
T-80U (1985): Further development with a better turret, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, improved gunsight, and 9M119 Svir missile system. In 1990 a new, 1,250-hp, engine was installed. Overall protection with Kontakt-5 against APFSDS/HEAT is 780/1,320 mm RHAe.9K119M with antitank guided missile 9M119M installed since 1990. Some of the tanks in the commander version (T-80UK) are equipped with Shtora-1 APS, and thermal imaging night sight TO1-PO2T (detection range/target classification range = 6,400/4,600 meters at night). The basic thermal night sight of the T-80U is within the limits of 1,750/1,500 meters..
The T-80UD Bereza (1987) is Ukrainian diesel version with 1,000-hp 6TD engine and remote-controlled antiaircraft machine gun..
The T-84 (1999) is Further Ukrainian development of T-80UD with 1,200-hp diesel and new welded turret..
The T-80BVD (2002): is KMDB's upgrade standard for Ukrainian T-80BVs. Changes include the 6TD diesel engine, remote-controlled commander's machine gun, and better optics. None were produced..
The T-80UM2/Black Eagle (prototype: cancelled): is Several Russian prototypes were shown at trade shows, with a longer chassis and extra pair of road wheels, and very a large turret with separate ammunition compartment..
The T-80BVM (2017) is up to 3,000 units, installed "Relikt" ERA, PNM Sosna-U gunner sight (as in the T-90, T-72B3), the improved 125mm gun 2A46M-4, the upgraded gas turbine engine and the upgrades of various other systems. More than 120 already in the service..
The T-80B (1978) is This model had a new turret, laser rangefinder, fire-control, and autoloader allowing the firing of a 9M112-1 Kobra antitank guided missile (80% hit probability while stopped and on the move), and improved composite armor. An improved, 1,100-hp, engine was added in 1980, a new gun in 1982, and fittings for reactive armor in 1985.
