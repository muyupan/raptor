This document describes the Grizzly 450 EPS Japanese 4x4 All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV).

The Yamaha Grizzly 450 IRS was a single cylinder, four-stroke ATV produced by Yamaha between 2009 and 2017. Yamaha Utility ATVs are built with one goal in mind: easing the workloads of those in tough outdoor
environments. This philosophy is engineered in every detail. Like torque-heavy engines that get you moving when terrain is tricky, or loads are heavy; e ort-reducing technologies like automatic transmission and Electric
Power Steering; and ergonomic designs which mean you'll still feel comfortable after a long day in the saddle.
Plus, they run economically and require low maintenance. Yamaha Utility ATVs are tireless workhorses - but that's not all they are. When time permits, these vehicles pack the punch to give riders a big dose of fun, too

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Japan.
