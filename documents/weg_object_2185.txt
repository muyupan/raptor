This document describes the M7A2 American Anti-Vehicle Mine.

The American M7A2 is a rectangular, sheet metal bodied, anti-vehicle landmine which is designed to damage or destroy vehicles by its blast effect.

The landmine has rounded edges and crimped on end covers with a prominent filling plug in one end.

The fuze cavity is open and the M603 pressure fuze is exposed.

The pressure plate is slotted and is secured to the sides of the landmine body by two rivets.

The landmine has an anti-disturbance fuze cavity which is often used to hold the main firing system.

Because of its low explosive content, the landmine is often stacked (two together) for greater effect.

The M7A2 can be located using metal detectors under most field conditions as well as visually if set in the tripwire mode.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Angola, Cambodia, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Myanmar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Somalia, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Thailand, Zambia.
