This document describes the S-300V (SA-12a Gladiator) Russian Long-Range Air Defense Missile System.

The S-300V air defense missile system was developed to engage short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, strategic and tactical aircraft, as well as early warning and electronic warfare aircraft. It was designed to counter the threat posed by Lance and Pershing ballistic missiles. The main role of the S-300V is to protect task forces and vital industrial and military installations against massed air attacks. Its reporting name in the West is SA-12 or Gladiator/Giant. 

The S-300V consists of:

9M82 SA-12b GIANT missile
9M83 SA-12a GLADIATOR missile
9A82 SA-12b GIANT TELAR
9A93 SA-12a GLADIATOR TELAR
9A84 GIANT Launcher/Loader Vehicle (LLV)
9A85 GLADIATOR Launcher/Loader Vehicle (LLV)
9S15 BILL BOARD Surveillance Radar system
9S19 HIGH SCREEN Sector Radar system
9S32 GRILL PAN Guidance Radar system
9S457 Command Station

Note: The S-300V comes in two versions:  
1. SA-12a Gladiator
2. SA-12b Giant

Once equipped with 9M83 missiles is referred in the West as SA-12A or Gladiator. When equipped with 9M82 missiles it is referred as SA-12B or Giant.

The 9M83 SA-12a GLADIATOR is a dual-role anti-missile and anti-aircraft missile with a maximum range between 75 and 90 km.

The 9M82 SA-12b GIANT missile, configured primarily for the ATBM role, is a longer range system [maximum range between 100 and 200 km] with a longer fuselage with larger solid-fuel motor.
The 9A82 SA-12b GIANT and 9A93 SA-12a GLADIATOR TELAR vehicles are similar, though the 9A83-1 carries four 9M83 SA-12a GLADIATOR missiles, whereas the 9A82 carries only two 9M82 SA-12b GIANT missiles. The configuration of the vehicles command radar is also different. On the 9A83-1 the radar is mounted on a folding mast providing 360º coverage in azimuth and full hemispheric coverage in elevation. The radar on the 9M82 TELAR is mounted in a semi-fixed position over the cab, providing 90º coverage on either side in azimuth and 110º in elevation. The TELARs are not capable of autonomous engagements, requiring the support of the GRILL PAN radar.

The 9S457-1 Command Post Vehicle is the command and control vehicle for the SA-12 system, which is supported by the BILL BOARD A surveillance radar and the HIGH SCREEN sector radar. The CPV and its associated radars can detect up to 200 targets, track as many as 70 targets and designate 24 of the targets to the brigade's four GRILL PAN radar systems for engagement by the SA-12a and SA-12b TELARs.

The BILL BOARD A radar provides general surveillance, with the antenna rotating every 6-12 seconds. The radar, which can detect up to 200 targets, provides target coverage of 0-55º in elevation and 10-250 km in range with an accuracy is 30-35 min of arc in azimuth and 250 m in range. and.

The HIGH SCREEN sector radar supports the ATBM role, providing surveillance of anticipated azimuths of threat missiles. The radar is switches to a tracking mode when high speed targets are detected, automatically transmitting the trajectory parameters to the Command Post Vehicle. The CPV prioritizes the threat and instructs the HIGH SCREEN radar to track specific missiles, with the maximum being 16 simultaneous targets.

The GRILL PAN radar system controls the battery's launcher vehicles (TELARs and LLVs). It can simultaneously track up to 12 targets and control up to six missiles against these targets The radar can acquire targets with a radar cross-section of 2m2 at a range of 150 km in manual mode and 140 km in automatic mode. The GRILL PAN tracks targets assigned to it by the CP while simultaneously maintaining a horizon search for new targets.

The LLVs (9A85 GLADIATOR and 9A83 GLADIATOR) resemble normal TELARs, but with a loading crane rather than command radars. While the primary role of the LLV is to replenish the TELARs, they can also erecting and launch missiles if needed, though they are dependent on the use of command radars from neighboring TELARs.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Egypt, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine.
