This document describes the HQ-7B (FM-90) Chinese 6x6 Short-Range Air Defense Missile System.

The original HongQi 7 (HQ-7) short-range air defense missile system has been developed in China in the 1980s. It was a copy of the French Crotale. In 1978-1979 China imported some of the Thomson-CSF Crotale systems for evaluation and reverse-engineered them. The first Chinese clone was produced for testing in 1983. Its production commenced in the late 1980s. Sometimes it is referred to as Sino-Crotale. Its improved variant, the HQ-7A, was introduced in 1998.

   The HQ-7B is the latest version, based on an indigenous 6x6 armored chassis. It was first revealed somewhere in 2009. This air defense system is widely used by the Chinese armed forces. It is also being proposed for export customers as the FM-90. This air defense system has been exported to Pakistan.

   A TELAR vehicle carries four missiles and is fitted with engagement radar. It appears that the engagement radar is similar to that of the previous HQ-7A.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, Turkmenistan.
