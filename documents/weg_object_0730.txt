This document describes the Evo II RTK Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The Evo II RTK Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)series integrates an entirely new RTK module, which provides real-time centimeter-level positioning data and supports Post-Processing Kinematic (PPK). The aircraft can record the original satellite observation data, camera exposure parameters, and various other data. The positioning system supports the A-RTK base station and RTK network, which helps to achieve accurate and stable data acquisition in complex operating environments.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
