This document describes the CN-235 Indonesian Transport Aircraft.

The CASA/IPTN CN-235 is a medium-range twin-engined transport aircraft that was jointly developed by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) of Spain and Indonesian manufacturer IPTN, as a regional airliner and military transport. Its primary military roles include maritime patrol, surveillance, and air transport. Its largest user is Turkey, which has 59 aircraft.

The project was a joint venture between Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) and Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia), formerly known as IPTN, which formed Airtech International to manage the programme. The partnership applied only to the Series 10 and Series 100/110, with later versions being developed independently. Over 230 of all versions of CN-235 are in service and have accumulated more than 500,000 flight hours.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Gabon, Indonesia, Ireland, Jordan, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Spain, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United States of America.
