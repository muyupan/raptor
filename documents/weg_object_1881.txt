This document describes the M240 American 7.62mm General-Purpose Machine Gun.

Hezbollah Proliferation. The M240, officially the Machine Gun, 7.62 mm, M240, is the US military designation for the FN MAG (Mitrailleuse A Gaz, 'gas-operated machine gun'; alternatively, Mitrailleuse d'Appui General 'machine gun, support, general'), a family of belt-fed, gas-operated medium machine guns that chamber the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge.

The M240 has been used by the United States Armed Forces since the late 1970s. It is used extensively by infantry, most often in rifle companies, as well as on-ground vehicles, watercraft, and aircraft. Despite being heavier than some comparable weapons, it is highly regarded for reliability and its standardization among NATO members is a major advantage.

All variants are fed from disintegrating belts and are capable of firing most types of 7.62 mm (.30/.308 cal) NATO ammunition. M240 variants can be converted to use non-disintegrating belts. There are significant differences in weight and some features among some versions which restrict the interchangeability of parts. The M240s used by the US military are currently manufactured by FN America, the American subsidiary of FN Herstal.

The M240B and M240G are usually fired from an integrated bipod, a tripod, or a vehicular mount; regarding tripod use, the U.S. Army primarily uses the M192 Lightweight Ground Mount, while the U.S. Marine Corps uses the M122A1 tripod, a slightly updated M2 tripod.

Loading the M240 can be done either with the bolt forward or to the rear. If the bolt is to remain forward, the operator will then load the rounds into the feeding block (feed tray cover closed); or will open the feed tray cover, load the rounds onto the feeding tray, then close the feed tray cover. The charging handle will then be pulled to the rear, which locks the bolt to the rear. The weapon is then placed on the safe and the charging handle is then placed back to the forward position (this is spring-loaded on the tank-mounted variation). The weapon is now ready for operation.

The weapon fires from the open bolt position, meaning that the bolt is held to the rear and only moves forward as it is firing around. The firing pin is static and the bolt moves around the firing pin, circumventing any need for a hammer. A sear is used to time the internal mechanisms of the weapon to provide a consistent rate of fire, ensuring proper function and accuracy. However, firing from an open bolt also provides the possibility of an accidental discharge due to a bolt override. This happens when there is enough force for the bolt to jump over the sear and fire without the trigger being pulled. The safety of the weapon cannot stop this from happening. The safest way to protect against this is to leave the bolt forward on the weapon until the operator is ready to fire the weapon; then charge the weapon and fire.

Clearing the weapon is performed by ensuring that the bolt is locked to the rear and the weapon is safe. The top cover is then lifted, the remaining belt (if any) is swept out of the feed tray, and the feed tray is lifted to visually inspect the chamber and the face of the bolt. Any links or brass casings are removed. The weapon is now clear. In the extremely unlikely event that a live round is on the bolt face, it is knocked loose with a cleaning rod or another rigid object. If there is a live round lodged in the barrel, the operator must immediately decide if the barrel is hot enough that there is a chance of it cooking off. If there is, he will immediately move his face away from the opening of the weapon; and aim the gun in a direction that is perceived to take the least amount of damage and/or casualties should the event of a cook-off occur. He should then wait for the barrel to cool off before attempting to remove it. He can also attempt to extract the round by closing the cover, taking the weapon off of the safe, and pulling the trigger. This will likely cause the weapon to fire, so care should be made in ensuring that the weapon is first pointed in a safe direction.

The rate of fire may be controlled by three different gas regulator settings. The first setting allows the weapon to cycle at 650–750 rounds per minute, the second set is 750–850 rounds per minute, and the third setting is 850–950 rounds per minute. These settings are changed by dismounting the barrel, removing the gas regulator collar, and turning the gas regulator to allow more or less gas to move through the weapon system. It is generally performed only when necessary to return the gun to operation after fouling has caused sluggish operation and there is no time to properly clean the weapon.

The barrels can be exchanged rapidly, thanks to a barrel release button located on the left side of the weapon. The weapon is cleared first and then the button is held down, while the barrel's carrying handle is moved from the right side of the weapon to the center, unlocking it from the receiver. At this point, the button is released and the barrel is then pulled free of the receiver and placed to the side. The new barrel is inserted into the receiver and then the carrying handle is shifted to the right, locking it into place. Headspace is set by counting the clicks as the barrel is locked down and should be between two and seven clicks.

During prolonged firing, care must be taken to not allow exposed skin to come in contact with the weapon. The barrels can become hot enough to inflict second-degree burns instantly without becoming visibly different. These hot barrels glow brightly to anyone using any sort of optics sensitive to infrared radiation, such as night vision devices.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Argentina, Georgia, Iraq, Lebanon, Non-State Actors, Philippines, Spain, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, United States of America, Viet Nam.

Here is Variants information for the M240 American 7.62mm General-Purpose Machine Gun:
The Note is The manufacturer's name for the weapon is the MAG 58. The M240 adheres to FN MAG-58 specifications, allowing parts to be interchanged with other standard MAG-58s. This has significant advantages in training, logistics support, tactical versatility, and joint operations. For example, a US unit with attached British troops could supply replacement parts for the L7s, and vice versa..
The M240, M240E1, and M240C is The M240 is designed as a coaxial machine gun for tanks and 7.62 mm firepower on light armored vehicles. The M240 is part of the secondary armament on the U.S. Army M1 series Abrams tank, M2/M3 series Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the U.S. Marine Corps LAV-25.

The M240E1 is the US Marine Corps version of the original M240 coaxial/pintle-mounted machine gun, that is used on vehicles, like the LAV-25. It can also be fitted with spade grips for flexible use, like the ones from the M240D.

The M240C is the right-hand variant on the original coaxial (installed alongside the main weapon) M240, it is identical to the M240 except for the ammunition cover and feed tray. It has a right-handed feed for use on the M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle and LAV as the coaxial machine gun. It is fed from the left on the M1 Abrams and another M1 variant (M1A1, M1A2, M1A2 SEP) tanks. The M240C uses a charging cable instead of a charging handle, has a cut-off pistol grip, and has a special paddle assembly that allows the trigger to be actuated by means of a solenoid. Since the machine gun is not meant to be handled during use, the barrel is fully exposed and must be handled with asbestos mittens during barrel changes..
The M240B is The M240B (formerly called as the M240E4) is the standard infantry medium machine gun of the U.S. Marine Corps. The US Navy and Coast Guard likewise utilize the weapon system. It is also still used by some Army units. It comes configured for ground combat with a buttstock and bipod, though it can also be mounted on a tripod, ground vehicles, aircraft, aboard ships, and small boats. It is almost always referred to as an "M240 Bravo" or even just "240" verbally.
The M240D is The M240D is an upgrade of the M240E1, primarily in the addition of an optical rail on the receiver cover. It has two possible configurations: aircraft and egress (ground). In the aircraft configuration, the M240D has a front and rear sight and a trigger group that accommodates the spade grip device, while the ground configuration involves the installation of an Egress Package or "infantry modification kit", which is designed to provide downed aircrew personnel with increased firepower. The Egress Package contains a buttstock assembly, a buffer assembly, a bipod assembly, and a conventional trigger assembly.

The M240D is issued for aircraft configuration. The barrel assembly contains a three-position gas plug. The first gas plug position allows the weapon to cycle at 650–750 rounds per minute (RPM), the second gas plug positions allow the weapon to fire at 750–850 rounds per minute (RPM), and the third gas plug position allows the weapon to fire at 850–950 rounds per minute (RPM). The aircraft configured M240D weighs 25.6 lb (11.6 kg) and is 42.3 in (1074.42 mm) long, while the egress configuration weighs 26.2 lb (11.9 kg) and is 49 in (1244.6 mm) long..
The M240H is The M240H (formerly designated as the M240E5) is an improvement of the M240D, the M240H features a rail-equipped feed cover, an improved flash suppressor, and has been configured so that it can be more quickly converted to infantry standard using an Egress Kit. The M240H has an overall length of 41.6 in (1056.6 mm) with a 21.7 in (551.2 mm) barrel and weighs 26.3 pounds (11.9 kg) empty, and has a rate of fire of 550–650 rounds per minute (RPM). The M240H entered service in 2004 on U.S. Army helicopters. It is equipped with dual spade grips and thumb-activated trigger systems and can be quickly converted for dismounted infantry use via an egress components kit that includes a bipod and conventional pistol grip trigger module..
The M240N is The M240N is designed with a front and rear sight and configured specifically for mounting on watercraft. It is similar to the M240G, but lacks the integral bipod. It also uses the hydraulic buffer of the M240B, and features the lower cyclic rate of fire of the M240B which is around 550–650 rounds per minute (RPM)..
The M240G is The M240G allows for commonality throughout the Marine Corps whether the weapon is used in an infantry, vehicular, or airborne role. The M240G is the ground version of the original M240 or M240E1, 7.62 mm medium-class weapon designed as a coaxial/pintle-mounted machine gun for tanks and LAVs. The M240G can be modified for ground use by the installation of an "infantry modification kit" (a flash suppressor, front sight, carrying handle for the barrel, a buttstock, infantry length pistol grip, bipod, and rear sight assembly). The M240G lacks a front heat guard, and as such is a few pounds lighter than the M240B, weighing in at 25.6 pounds (11.6 kg). The rate of fire of the M240G can be controlled by three gas settings. On gas setting one, the weapon will fire at 650–750 rounds per minute, on gas setting two the weapon will fire at 750–850 rounds per minute, and on gas setting three, the weapon will fire at 850–950 rounds per minute. The size of the gas port increases resulting in greater energy being delivered to the action. Use at high settings induces added stresses on the action and results in the shorter service life of the weapon. It gives the operator the ability to adjust the gas bleed to the action. This also allows the weapon to continue firing when very dirty from sustained use in combat conditions when it may be otherwise rendered inoperable due to an extremely dirty and dry action..
The M240L is The M240L (M240 Lima), formerly the M240E6 is the product of the M240B Weight Reduction Program which reduces the weight of the existing M240B by 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg). To achieve 18% weight savings, the M240L incorporates titanium construction and alternative manufacturing methods for fabricating major components. The resulting improvements reduced the soldier's combat load while allowing easier handling and movement of the weapon. The M240L may replace the M240B in U.S. Army service. It was type classified in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2010.

Titanium was used to make the receiver body, front sight post, and carrying handle while maintaining steel operating system components. Manufacture had to be adjusted because titanium takes longer to machine than steel and requires more frequent replacement of tooling bits; more pliable stainless steel rivets were used, and the receiver was coated with boron and chrome carbo-nitride coatings with a ceramic-based top coat to preserve it under extreme operating temperatures. The M240L weighs 22.3 lb (10.1 kg) with a standard-length barrel and standard stock and weighs 21.8 lb (9.9 kg) with a shorter barrel and collapsible stock. The short barrel is 4 in (100 mm) shorter than a standard M240 barrel, and with the collapsible stock, the M240L can be made 7 in (180 mm) shorter. The smaller and lighter variant of the M240L is the M240P, which is still in a testing phase in Afghanistan. The M240P is not used as often as its predecessors. The Army initially bought 4,500 M240Ls and plans to buy 12,000 total..
The Barrett 240LW is The Barrett 240LW (Light Weight) program has its design roots in the original U.S. Army solicitation for a lighter M240 medium machine gun in 2010. The program called for a much lighter version of the M240, while keeping the same familiar open bolt design that the machine gun is world-renowned for. This was formally known as the M240B Weight Reduction Program or the M240E6. The results of that solicitation ended with the adoption of the M240L by the U.S. Army. By producing the receiver out of titanium, instead of steel, FN delivered a lightweight solution by trimming the weight of the M240B by 5.5 pounds, or an 18 percent weight reduction of the original machine gun, giving it an overall weight of 22.3 pounds. The Lima is in limited service with the U.S. Army..
The Barrett 240LWS is The Barrett 240LWS (Light Weight Short) gas-operated, belt-fed, open bolt, a medium machine gun is a shortened variant of the 240LW program. The design concept of this variant is to produce a viable medium machine gun that would serve in a special operations capacity, where a small team of operators could maximize a medium machine gun by having it in a shorter and lighter package than its big brother, the 240LW, or the equivalent M240B. This follows in the footsteps of the Mk 48 and the M60E6 medium machine guns, also designed for the small unit role. The Mk 48 is a variant of the M249 LMG, scaled up to chamber 7.62×51mm NATO; it has come across some issues in its service life; it was never designed to be a general-purpose machine gun, while the M60E6 arguably came too late to make a difference in USMC and US Army general machine gun adoption, being that the M240 design was well standardized within the DoD ranks. Both offerings are more focused on Special Operations in US Service..
