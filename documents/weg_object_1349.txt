This document describes the PPRU-1 (Dog Ear) Russian Mobile Reconnaissance and Control Post.

The PPRU-1 Dog Ear (with the Russian designation of 9S80) is a Russian ground-based, target-acquisition radar mounted on an MT-LB multi-purpose tracked vehicle or MT-LBu armored command and reconnaissance vehicle (ACRV). It uses an open-mesh, rounded-rectangle parabolic antenna. The radar supplies target alerting information to the SA-13 Gopher (Russian 9K35 Strela-10) surface-to-air missile (SAM) system. Deployment usually involves one system for each air defense battery/battalion. The Dog Ear is in service with SA-13 Gopher SAM batteries. In some cases, upgraded SA-13 systems may have replaced the Dog Ear. Production reportedly began in 1983.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Angola, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, CFE Treaty, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Georgia, India, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Libya, Macedonia, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine.
