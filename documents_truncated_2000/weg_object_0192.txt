This document describes the 9K112 Kobra (AT-8 Songster) Russian Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM).

9K112 Kobra (AT-8 Songster) Russian Anti-Tank Missile is a SACLOS Anti-Tank Guided Missile system of the Soviet Union. It is fired from the 125 mm main guns of the T-64 and T-80 series of tanks. A newer design based on the same concept is the 9M119 (NATO reporting name AT-11 Sniper).

The 9M112 Kobra missile consists of two sections:

9M43 head section – containing the 9M129 shaped charge warhead and the 9D129 sustainer motor
9B447 tail section – containing a battery, the flight controls, a light source for the guidance system on the tank to track, and a small antenna to receive commands from the tank
The two separate sections are stored in the autoloader of the tank in the same way as conventional 125 mm rounds. As the round is hoisted into the gun the two halves are mated together.

The missile can be fired in any of three modes:

Primary mode – the gun is elevated three degrees above the line of sight to reduce the amount of dust generated by the missile launch. This is critical since the tank has to see both the target and the light source on the rear of the missile in order to be able to guide the missile to the target. The missile system uses SACLOS guidance, the gunner has to keep the crosshairs centered on the target, and the 1A33 fire control system generates course corrections, which are broadcast to the missile. Accuracy at 4000 m is estimated to be 80% in this mode.
Ballistic mode – the gun is elevated three degrees above the line of sight. The missile then flies three to five meters above the gunner's line of sight, dropping down to the line of sight just before reaching the target. This further reduces the amount of dust kicked up by the flight of the missile, reducing the chance of the guidance system losing the missile.
Emergency mode – this mode is only for use when a target suddenly appears within 1000 m and the missile is already loaded. The gun is at only 40 minutes of arc above the line of sight to the target, and the command link is activated early. The hit probability is lower in this mode.
The missile has a muzzle velocity of 125 m/s, this increases to 800 m/s at its peak, but averages out at 350 to 400 meters a second. The flight time to 4000 meters is 9 to 10 seconds. The missile has a single 4.5 kg HEAT warhead, which can penetrate 600 mm of RHA.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.

Here is Variants information for the 9K112 Kobra (AT-8 Songster) Russian Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM):
The 9M112 is basic version of the missile, entered service in 1976 as part of the 9K112 missile system in the T-64B.
The 9M112M is upgraded modification tested in 1977 and adopted in 1978 as part of the 9K112-1 missile system in the T-80B, armour penetration increased by 20%. Production started in 1979..
The 9M112M2 is 9M112 variant with armour penetration increased by 40% compared with the initial model, testing started in 1983. The missile's dimensions and operating conditions remained unchanged..
The 9M124 is variant of the 9M112M2, similar in design, but has a more powerful warhead (armour penetration increased by 80% relative to the base variant of the missile).
The 9M128 is upgraded missile system called "Agona" with a tandem warhead; development started in 1984 but, in 1985, the Svir and Refleks missile systems entered service in place of "Agona". Nevertheless, in 1986, "Agona" entered the state tests, and in 1988 it was put into service..
