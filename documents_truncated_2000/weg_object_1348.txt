This document describes the Barnaul-T Russian Air Defense Command and Control System.

The Barnaul-T air defense control system is designed to detect aerial targets and control air defense systems of the Army, marine units, and the Airborne Force. The system uses the 9S932-1 intelligence and control module with 1L122-1E radar mounted on an MT-LBu tracked chassis.

Baseline air defense command & control subsystem of the integrated troop and weapon management system. The Barnaul-T baseline air defense command and control subsystem is designed to fit tactical units’ air defense (AD) control posts (CP) with advanced automation, communication, and data exchange equipment in order to effectively control air defense troops and weapons, coordinate their activities, and increase their mobility and survivability under any combat conditions.

The Barnaul-T baseline set is used to equip:
* AD division/brigade CP (mission planning module (MPM) mounted on the 9S931-1 wheeled chassis);

* AD regiment CP (MP-K 9S931-1 and 9S931 MPM);

* AD battalion CP (9S931 MPM);

* Battery command and control (C2) post (9S932-1 reconnaissance and control vehicle with 1L122-1E radar);

* MANPADS platoon C2 post (9S933 portable fire control unit);

* SAM squad – 9S935 MANPADS squad automation equipment set.
 

The configuration of the Barnaul-T baseline set depends on the organizational structure of the Customer’s tactical military units.

The baseline set performs the following major tasks in automated mode:

* Athering (reception) of air situation data from superior, interacting, and subordinate C2 posts, and a heliborne radar picket system; target tracking, radar data identification and display; reception and display of data on the friendly aircraft patrol area, interception lines, flight corridors, and joint action and cooperation areas;

* Reception of alerts and battle commands from the superior C2 post, generation of reports based on them, and target tracks with flight parameters;

* Control over subordinate C2 posts and radars, the transmission of alert information and data on the areas (sectors) of responsibility to such C2 posts and radars; reception, processing, display, and transmission of operational/tactical information on the position, status, and battle readiness of friendly troops; target allocation at each level of command, the transmission of target designation and cease-fire commands to subordinate assets, based on the battle readiness, availability of free target channels and missiles;

* Equipment test, engagement process recording;

* Stand-alone and system-level integrated training of combat crews.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
