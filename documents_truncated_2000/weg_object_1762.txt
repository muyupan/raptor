This document describes the TA5380 Chinese 8x8 Special Wheeled Chassis.

The TAS5380 is a 20-ton 8x8 special heavy duty truck developed and built by Taian Special Vehicle Manufacturer and used by the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China as a transport/Transporter erector launcher.

The TAS5380 specializes in carrying ballistic missiles, large-caliber artillery rockets, radar equipment as well as other forms of military assets. Unlike the much larger Wanshan WS51200 and the WS21200, the TA580/TAS5380 cannot carry much larger intermediate-range ballistic missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Nevertheless, the TA580/TAS5380 has a maximum payload capacity of 20 tons, of which it primarily carries the HQ-9 air defense missile system.

The TAS5380 comes in two additional variants. The TA5382 accommodates an additional four passengers due to the presence of a double cab, as well as being able to mount the WM-80 and WM-120 artillery rocket system. The TA5501 is essentially a much larger variant with a 10x10 configuration, which offers better stability and mobility.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
