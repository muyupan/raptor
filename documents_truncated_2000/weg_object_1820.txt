This document describes the AN/PED-1 American Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR).

The Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder AN/PED-1 provides a unique capability to Forward Observers, Forward Air Controllers and Naval Gunfire Spot Teams. The system can recognize targets in day/night/obscurant conditions, range to the target at an eye safe wavelength, and calculate grid coordinates with its own GPS/Elevation/Azimuth capability. The system then provides this information to other members of the Digital Battlefield. Also included is a NATO coded laser designator for use with Semi-Active Laser Guided Missiles and Laser Spot Trackers.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the AN/PED-1 American Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR):
The AN/PED-1A LLDR 2 is A reduced weight version that uses the AN/PSD-1A TLM II and the AN/PEQ-9A diode compact laser designator module.
The AN/PED-1B LLDR 2H is Uses the AN/PSD-1B TLM IIH (with celestial navigation integrated with the digital magnetic compass) and the AN/PEQ-9A diode laser designator module.
The AN/PED-1 LLDR 3 is A development on the previous LLDR versions that adds precision azimuth vertical angle module technology, which enables improved 24/7 all-weather precision targeting capability..
