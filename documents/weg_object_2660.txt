The Véhicule de l'avant blindé or VAB ("Armoured vanguard vehicle" in French) is an armored personnel carrier and support vehicle designed by Renault of France. It entered service in 1976; around 5,000 were produced. As of 2019, it is the standard APC of the French Army and has also been exported to more than 15 countries. It saw combat in various conflicts in Africa, Asia, and Europe.

VAB means “Véhicule de l’Avant Blindé”, literally “Vanguard Armoured Vehicle” which does not tells that it was an armored personnel carrier and the most prolific of the French Army by far. 5000+ indeed has been built since its introduction in 1976, both in 4×4 and 6×6 configuration, declined into 35 variants and exported to 15 countries over time. With 3,900 vehicles the French Army is the largest operator of the type, and now most vehicles are modernized while there is a second-generation VAB (called Mk. II) currently developed for escort.
