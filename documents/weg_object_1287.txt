This document describes the 9K31 Strela-1 (SA-9 Gaskin) Russian 4x4 Infrared Guided Surface-to-Air Missile System.

The 9K31 Strela-1 (SA-9 Gaskin) Russian 4x4 Infrared Guided Surface-to-Air Missile System is a highly mobile, short-range, low altitude infra-red guided surface-to-air missile system. Originally developed by the Soviet Union under the GRAU designation 9K31, it is commonly known by its NATO reporting name, SA-9 "Gaskin". The system consists of a BRDM-2 amphibious vehicle, mounting two pairs of ready-to-fire 9M31 missiles.

The 9K31 is based on the BRDM-2 4x4 chassis. The driver and commander are seated in the front and the gunner in the turret. Up to four launch containers can be attached to the turret. During travel, the missiles are lowered. The 9K31 is a stand-alone system, but usually, it operates in pairs or groups of four. Target information is relayed by radio by other air defense systems. The turret is fitted with four 9M31 Strela-1 surface-to-air missiles with infrared guidance. The maximum effective range is 4.2 km and the maximum altitude is 3 km. Due to the limitations of the seeker the maximum range can only be achieved under favorable circumstances. Effectiveness during head-on engagements and at night is much reduced.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Hungary, India, Libya, Mauritania, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Syria, Uganda, Ukraine, Viet Nam, Yemen.

Here is Fire Control information for the 9K31 Strela-1 (SA-9 Gaskin) Russian 4x4 Infrared Guided Surface-to-Air Missile System:
The Sights with Magnification is INA.
The Elecro-optical/ Infrared System is Day Range (m):  6,500  
Night Range (m): 2,000 tail chase only.
The Navigation is Inertial.
The IFF is INA.
The RF Direction-Finder is The FLAT BOX-A passive system uses several Pelengator sensors mounted on the vehicle to detect aircraft navigation signals for early warning and DF of approach azimuth. Detection range is up to 30 km.  Many forces with this older air defense system are not proficient in using the RF DF system..
The Guidance Systemm is Infrared homing.

Here is Associated Vehicle Radar System information for the 9K31 Strela-1 (SA-9 Gaskin) Russian 4x4 Infrared Guided Surface-to-Air Missile System:
The Name is PPRU-1/Ovod AD ACV.
The Chassis is MTLB-U.
The Radar is DOG EAR (use in OPFOR units).
The Function is Target Acquisition.
