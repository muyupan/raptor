This document describes the RT-2000 (Thunderbolt-2000) Taiwanese 8x8 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL).

The Thunderbolt-2000 is a wheeled MLRS system used by the Republic of China (Taiwan) Army. It was created with the intention of attacking enemy forces when disembarking from sea.

The prototype of the Thunderbolt-2000 weapon system was originally placed on the chassis of a M977 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck. The production model utilizes MAN HX81 8x8 wheeled trucks instead, with the first order batch including 57 launchers and 54 ammunition carriers/re-loaders or local production of the same version. The LT-2000 was scheduled to enter service with all 3 main army groups in Taiwan from 2010, with each army group's artillery corps receiving 1 battalion of RT/LT-2000, featuring 3 companies/batteries with 6 RT/LT-2000 launchers each. The original CSIST LT-2000 prototype battery is in service with Kinmen Command, deployed there since mid-2000.

Munitions: 

The LT/RT-2000 uses three types of munitions: Mk15 (60 rounds, 3 pods of 20 round each, 15 km range), Mk30 (27 rounds, 3 pods of 9 rounds each, 30 km range) and Mk45 (12 rounds, 2 pods of 6 rounds each, 45 km range). While the Mk15 is the 117 mm rockets used by the Kung Feng VI that carries 6,400 6.4mm size steel balls, the Mk30 rocket is a bit larger than the Mk15 at 180mm caliber and can carry either 267 rounds of M77 Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) bomblets or 18,300 8mm size steel balls with range of 30 km. And Mk45 larger than the Mk30 at 227mm caliber as it can carry either 518 rounds of M77 bomblets or 25,000 8mm steel balls with range of 45 km. Other types of munitions also being developed by CSIST/ROC (Taiwan) Army, including FAE bomblets.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Taiwan.
