This document describes the H-6 (Hong-6) Chinese Strategic Bomber.

The Xian H-6 (Hōng-6) is a license-built version of the Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 twin-engine jet bomber, built for China's People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).

Delivery of the Tu-16 to China began in 1958, and the Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC) signed a license production agreement with the USSR to build the type in the late 1950s. The first Chinese Tu-16, or "H-6" as it was designated in Chinese service, flew in 1959. Production was performed by the plant at Xian, with at least 150 built into the 1990s. China is estimated to currently operate around 120 aircraft.

The latest version is the H-6N, a heavily redesigned version capable of aerial refueling and carrying air-launched cruise missiles. According to the United States Department of Defense, this will give the PLAAF a long-range standoff offensive air capability with precision-guided munitions.

The first domestically produced H-6 was completed in 1968 and evidence of bombing training was recorded by U.S. spy satellites on August 13, 1971. By March of the following year, the CIA estimated that the PRC had 32 aircraft operational with an additional 19 awaiting completion.

The H-6 was used to drop nine nuclear devices at the Lop Nur test site. However, with the increased development in ballistic missile technology, the nuclear delivery capabilities that the H-6 offered diminished in importance. The CIA estimated in 1976 that the H-6 had moved over to a dual nuclear/conventional bombing role.

Along with the H-6 free-fall bomber, an "H-6A" nuclear bomber was built, as well as an "H-6B" reconnaissance variant, "H-6C" conventional bomber, and "H-6E" nuclear bomber with improved countermeasures, the "H-6D" anti-ship missile carrier, and the "HY-6" series capable of acting as an in-flight fuel tanker. The H-6D was introduced in the early 1980s and carried a C-601 anti-shipping missile (NATO codename "Silkworm"), an air-launched derivative of the Soviet P-15 Termit ("Styx") under each wing. The H-6D featured various modernized systems and sports an enlarged radome with a Type 245 Kobalt I-band surveillance radar under the nose. The Type 245 radar was based on the Soviet PSBN-M-8 NATO codename Mushroom radar used on the Tupolev Tu-16. Earlier versions (Type 241, 242, and 244) were installed on the early models of the H-6. The H-6 has also been used as a tanker and drone launcher. Later H-6 production featured extended curved wingtips.

Many H-6A and H-6C aircraft were updated in the 1990s to the "H-6F" configuration, the main improvement being a modern navigation system, with a Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation receiver, Doppler navigation radar, and inertial navigation system. New production began in the 1990s as well, with Xian building the "H-6G", which is a director for ground-launched cruise missiles; the "H-6H", which carries two land-attack cruise missiles. In terms of land-attack cruise missiles, five immediate possibilities were considered by PLAAF - the indigenous HN-1, HN-2 and HN-3, DH-10/CJ-10, and a variant of Russian-designed cruise missiles. It is believed CJ-10 is chosen to be the main land-attack missile for H-6 bombers, and now the "H-6M" cruise missile carrier, which has four pylons for improved cruise missiles and is fitted with a terrain-following system. Apparently, these variants have no internal bomb capability, and most or all of their defensive armament has been deleted.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the H-6 (Hong-6) Chinese Strategic Bomber:
The Production Variants is Xian H-6 – Conventional bomber. Tupolev Tu-16 produced under license in China, first flew in 1959. A prototype conducted China’s first aerial nuclear weapon test at Lop Nor on 14 May 1965.
Xian H-6A – Nuclear bomber.
Xian H-6B – Aerial reconnaissance variant.
Xian H-6C – Conventional bomber with improved counter-measures suite. Initially designated H-6III.
Xian H-6D – Anti-ship missile carrier introduced in early 1980s, armed with two air-launched C-601 missiles, one mounted under each wing. Fitted with larger radome under the nose and various improved systems.
Later upgraded to either two C-301 supersonic anti-ship missiles, or four C-101 supersonic anti-ship missiles. An upgraded version, capable of carrying four YJ-8 (C-801) anti-ship missiles is currently under development. Initially designated H-6IV.
Xian H-6E – Strategic nuclear bomber with improved counter-measures suite, entered service in 1980s.
Xian H-6F – New designation for upgraded H-6A and H-6C. Many aircraft upgraded in the 1990s with new inertial navigation systems, doppler navigation radar and GPS receiver.
Xian H-6G – Provides targeting data to ground-launched cruise missiles, built in the 1990s. No internal bomb bay or defensive armament. Electronic-warfare aircraft with underwing electronic countermeasures pods.[28]
Xian H-6H – Land-attack cruise missile carrier armed with two missiles, built in the 1990s. No internal bomb bay or defensive armament.
Xian H-6K – Latest H-6 variant, re-engined with D-30KP turbofan engines of 12,000 kg thrust replacing the original Chinese turbojets. Other modifications include larger air intakes, re-designed flight deck with smaller/fewer transparencies and large dielectric nose radome.
Xian H-6J – Version of H-6K for use by the People’s Liberation Army Navy Air Force (PLANAF) to replace the H-6G; has greater payload and range with performance similar to H-6K.
Xian H-6M – Cruise missile carrier, fitted with terrain-following system and four under-wing hardpoints for weapons carriage. No internal bomb bay or defensive armament. Production of this variant is believed to have resumed in early 2006.
Xian H-6N/H-6X1 – Air-launched ballistic missile carrier in service as of 2019. This variant has a semi-recessed area hard point underneath its fuselage. It is capable of mounting an air-derivative of the Dongfeng-21D anti-ship ballistic missile or the CJ-100 supersonic cruise missile, with an added 3,700 mile range including aerial refueling or a variety of other oversized payloads - including those with nuclear warheads.[36] It may be also possible that the modification is to enable carriage of the WZ-8 high-speed, high-altitude reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle.
Xian HD-6 (Hongzhaji Dian-6) – Electronic warfare version with solid nose and canoe fairing believed to contain electronic counter-measures equipment..
The Aerial refuelling versions is Xian HY-6 (Hongzhaji You-6) – First successful in-flight refuelling tanker variant in Chinese service. Retained PV-23 fire control system of H-6 and thus can still be deployed as a missile launcher.
Xian HY-6U – Modified HY-6 tanker in service with the PLAAF, with PV-23 fire control system and Type 244 radar deleted, and thus a dedicated refueling aircraft Also referred as H-6U
Xian HY-6D – First aerial refueling tanker for PLANAF, converted from H-6D. The most distinct difference between HY-6U and HY-6D is that HY-6U has a metal nose cone, while HY-6D still has the transparent class nose. Like the original HY-6, PV-23 fire control system is also retained on HY-6D, which enables the aircraft also to serve as a missile carrying and launching platform.
Xian HY-6DU – Aerial refuelling tanker for the PLANAF, modified HY-6D, also referred as H-6DU. Similar to HY-6U, HY-6DU is a dedicated aerial refueling tanker when its PV-23 fire control system is removed from the aircraft..
