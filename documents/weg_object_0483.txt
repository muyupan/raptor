This document describes the Panghyon-2 North Korean Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

This North Korean variant is based on the ASN-105. It is capable of carrying a combat load of 44 to 55 lb (20 to 25 kg) and reaching an altitude of nearly 9,900 ft (3,000 m).

The ASN-105 is a medium tactical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in service with the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It is designed to perform real-time battlefield surveillance and intelligence collection.

Guided by GPS navigation, the ASN-105B is launched by rocket boost and lands with a parachute.

An ASN-105 system is made up of six UAVs, a main ground-control station, a mobile ground-control station, an image-processing shelter, a TV/infrared image interpreting shelter and a launcher.

The ASN-105B may have a redesigned fuselage and changes to the engine. Models displayed in 2004 had a more square-shaped fuselage, increased wing chord and modified engine exhaust. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 350 lb (160 kg) and a ceiling of 19,700 ft (6,000 m).

Status
The ASN-105A was first delivered to the PLA in the mid-1990s; the ASN-105B is also in service with China. The ASN-105A also serves with Pakistan.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).

Here is Variants information for the Panghyon-2 North Korean Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV):
The ASN 105 is ASN-105 is a fixed wing UAV in conventional layout with high wing configuration, and propulsion is provided by a two-blade fixed pitch propeller driven two-stroke engine mounted in the nose. ASN-105 is a development of ASN-104, and thus having identical layout. The main improvement of ASN-105 over its predecessor ASN-104 is that its remote control range is increased by two third, from the original 60 km to 100 km. Another improvement of ASN-105 over its predecessor ASN-104 is that its ground control station is fully computerized..
