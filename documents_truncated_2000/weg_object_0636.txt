This document describes the A-10 Thunderbolt II (Warthog) American Close Air Support Aircraft.

The A-10 Thunderbolt II is the U.S. Air Force’s primary low-altitude close air support aircraft. The A-10 is perhaps best known for its fearsome GAU-8 Avenger 30mm Gatling gun mounted on the nose. The GAU-8 is designed to fire armor-piercing depleted uranium and high explosive incendiary rounds. The A-10 has excellent maneuverability at low air speeds and altitude, and is a highly accurate and survivable weapons-delivery platform. The aircraft can loiter near battle areas for extended periods of time and operate in low ceiling and visibility conditions. The wide combat radius and short takeoff and landing capability permit operations in and out of locations near front lines. Using night vision goggles, A-10 pilots can conduct their missions during darkness.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the A-10 Thunderbolt II (Warthog) American Close Air Support Aircraft:
The A-10 (A-10A) is First production model..
The A-10 N/AW is This was a company-funded two-seat prototype for the night/adverse weather (N/AW) mission. It featured a second, elevated seat for a weapons system officer (WSO); a Westinghouse multi-mode radar; Texas Instruments forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor; General Electric low-light-level TV (LLLTV); and a Ferranti laser rangefinder. First flight took place on May 4, 1979. It was not produced. The N/AW variant was about 2,000 lbs (910 kg) heavier than the A-10A due to the second cockpit, additional equipment and fuel, fuselage extension and extended vertical tail fins. The WSO station would mirror the front cockpit instruments, including flight controls and engine throttle controls, save for the head-up display..
The OA-10 is A-10 aircraft were re-designated for forward air control (FAC) duties beginning in October 1987 as a replacement for the OV-10 Bronco. The GAU-8/A gun armament was retained, target-marking rockets were fitted and provisions made for the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile..
The A-10C is This variant features updated controls (some borrowed from supersonic jets), computers and digital targeting equipment as part of a major electronics overhaul. The modernization helps the A-10C variant avoid friendly-fire mistakes, drop satellite-guided smart bombs including JDAMs and WCMDs, conduct missions in all weather conditions. Specific improvements included hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) control; two Raytheon 5 in x 5 in (127 mm x 127 mm) multifunction cockpit displays; situational awareness data link (SADL); digital stores management system; a BAE Systems integrated flight and fire control computer (IFFCC); Sniper XR targeting pod; and Scorpion helmet-mounted sighting system. A-10s are also equipped with the Lightning targeting pod..
The Other Upgrades is The low-altitude safety and target enhancement (LASTE) program involved Grumman Aircraft Systems and General Electric. The development program sought to fit a ground-collision avoidance system (GCAS) to improve low-level survivability; and enhanced altitude control system (EACS) to invoke aircraft SAS during gun firing for greater accuracy; and an air-to-air self-defense gunsight. A turbine engine monitoring system/hot section life improvement modification was intended to increase engine life and reliability. There were also A-10 upgrades for close-air support/battlefield air interdiction (CAS/BAI), including a FLIR sensor and helmet-mounted display..
