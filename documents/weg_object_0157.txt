This document describes the YLC-4 Chinese 2D Long-Range Surveillance Radar.

YLC-4 is a Chinese UHF solid-state, fully coherent 2D long range surveillance radar, which is mainly used for long range surveillance. The radar has the ability to synthesize data from up to four other radars with a large data capacity, and to communicate and display the data and state of the system through the net to realize remote control and detection. When equipped with height-finding radar, it can perform the function of guidance and providing target data for an air traffic control system. With long range detection range, high reliability and easy maintenance, YLC-4 radar is a main radar in air defense network. The manufacturer of the system is Nanjing Research Institute of Electronics Technology (NRIET)/Nanjing Institute No. 1.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
