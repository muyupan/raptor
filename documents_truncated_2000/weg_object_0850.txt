This document describes the EVO Nano Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The EVO Nano Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is packed a 1/1.28-inch(0.8-inch) CMOS sensor capable of 50 MP photos. A RYYB color filter array design with a large aperture of f/1.9 offers superior noise reduction capabilities and the power to effortlessly produce quality images in low- light conditions. Track fast-moving subjects with incredible precision through PDAF + CDAF autofocus system; Squeeze rich detail from shadows and highlights no matter how extreme the lighting conditions using HDR mode, which rapidly snaps several photos at different exposures so they can be stitched together in post-production.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
