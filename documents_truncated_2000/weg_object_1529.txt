This document describes the Jerong Class Malaysian Fast Attack Craft.

The Jerung-class gunboat is a class of gunboats in service with the Royal Malaysian Navy. This class is based on the same design as the Intrépida-class fast attack craft in service with Argentine Navy, the Lurssen FPB/TNC-45 fast attack craft and are built by Hong-Leong Lurssen Shipyards. The Jerong class is equipped only with Bofors 57 mm gun and Bofors 40 mm gun for close-in combat and fire support, unlike other fast attack crafts in Malaysian service which are armed with anti-ship missiles. Peacetime duties include patrol of the exclusive economic zone, interception of illegal immigrants and anti-piracy operations. They are too small and under-armed for use in conventional warfare or in open waters. In late 2020 Royal Malaysian Navy confirmed that this class of ship will be upgrade to lengthening service period of older ships

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Malaysia.
