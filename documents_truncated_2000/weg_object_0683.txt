This document describes the R-27 (AA-10 Alamo) Russian Air-to-Air Missile.

The Vympel R-27 missile (NATO reporting name AA-10 Alamo) is a medium-to-long-range air-to-air missile developed by the Soviet Union. It remains in service with the Russian Air Force and air forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

The R-27 is manufactured in infrared-homing (R-27T), semi-active-radar-homing (R-27R), and active-radar-homing (R-27EA) versions, in both Russia and Ukraine. The R-27 missile is carried by the Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 fighters, and some of the later-model MiG-23MLD fighters have also been adapted to carry it. The R-27 missile is also license-produced in China, though the production license was bought from Ukraine instead of Russia.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Myanmar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Peru, Poland, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Sudan, Ukraine, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Yemen.
