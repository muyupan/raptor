The Autoloader is Yes,  Like the earlier domestic-use-only T-64, the T-72 is equipped with an automatic loading system, eliminating the need for a dedicated crewmember, decreasing the size and weight of the tank.

However, the autoloader is of a noticeably different design. Both the T-64 and T-72 carry their two-section 125 mm ammunition (shell and full propellant charge, or missile and reduced propellant charge) in separate loading trays positioned on top of each other; but firstly, in T-64, 28 of these were arranged vertically as a ring under the turret ring proper, and were rotated to put the correct tray into position under the hoist system in the turret rear. This had the disadvantage of cutting the turret off from the rest of the tank, most notably, the driver. Accessing the hull required partial removal of the trays. The T-72 uses a design that has lower width requirements and does not isolate the turret compartment: the trays are arranged in a circle at the very bottom of the fighting compartment; the trade-off is the reduction of the number of trays to 22. The second difference is that in the T-64 the trays were hinged together and were flipped open as they were brought into position, allowing both the shell/missile and propellant charge to be rammed into the breech in one motion; in the T-72 the tray is brought to the breech as-is, with the shell in the lower slot and the charge in the upper one, and the mechanical rammer sequentially loads each of them, resulting in a longer reloading cycle..

The Mine Clearing is The T-72 can be fitted with mine clearing equipment such as the KMT-5, KMT-6 and KMT-6M2. 

KMT-5: The KMT-5 mine clearing plow-roller set consists of two plows and two roller sections of three rollers each. This combination is attached to the front of a tank hull. Stretched between the roller sections is a "dogbone" assembly which consists of a light chain and small roller weights. Using a dragging motion, the "dogbone" covers the exposed area between tank tracks, thus exploding tilt-rod mines. The flexibility of the KMT-5 allows the use of plows or rollers depending on the terrain, type of soil and fuse types encountered. The KMT-5 can be used with the T-54/55, T-62, T-64, and T-72 tanks. The system can withstand approximately nine explosions that have a capacity of five to six kg. It is fitted with a quick-release disconnect unit to allow the tank driver to release the set rapidly. One other capability is that the KMT-5 may be used during night operation, using the luminous lane-marking device (PSK equipment) which marks the clear lane at night with a luminous substance..
