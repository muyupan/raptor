This document describes the Supacat 400 British 4x4 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The Supacat Protected Vehicle 400 (SPV 400) is a further evolution of Supacat’s long pedigree of developing relevant and effective military vehicles. Giving soldiers what they need for 21st century operations: superior mobility and protection.
Building on previous experience and integrating direct feedback from the operational use of our existing fleet, the SPV 400 takes the performance levels of lightweight protected mobility platforms beyond that currently on offer around the globe. “Fully integrated protection” is the key to the SPV formula which, combined with a cutting edge bespoke automotive solution, offers exceedingly high levels of protection yet remains sufficiently packaged to access the tightest of terrain.

The SPV 400 mirrors the “go anywhere” ethos of other Supacat products and provides supreme cross-country performance as well as providing the protection required to operate in an urban environment. The operator’s needs and the integration of modern battlefield systems have been considered from the outset so the SPV 400 is a highly attractive and ‘useable’ solution for 21st Century operations.

The SPV 400 patrol variant can be adapted for use by fitting alternative and interchangeable mission pods that include ambulance, logistic, command and open top weapon mounted variants.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
