This document describes the AH-4 Chinese 155mm Towed Howitzer.

The AH-4 is a Chinese clone of the US, M777, lightweight towed howitzer. It is intended mainly for export. The AH-4 was revealed in 2014. Soon after its introduction this howitzer reportedly received its first export order from Middle East.
Can fire all of the western-made 155mm/39 caliber rounds.

The towed AH4 howitzer is a Chinese artillery system manufactured by Norinco. Its main characteristic is that it has been designed to be lightweight, which allows greater tactical mobility. The weight of 4,500 kg, compared to a traditional system that can weigh 18,000 kg, allows the system to be airlifted via heavy-lift helicopters like the CH-47 or Mi-26, or transport aircraft like a C-130 or Y-8. Also, as a modern howitzer system, it possesses a range of engagement of up to 40 km using rocket-assisted projectiles.

Because of its weight, the AH4 can be used in mountain warfare, which traditionally had to use pack howitzers like the OTO Melara Mod 56.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, United Arab Emirates.
