This document describes the 2S31 Vena Russian Amphibious 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar.

The 2S31 Vena is a self-propelled gun/mortar of Russian origin. It was developed as a more capable and more high-end alternative to the wheeled 2S23 Nona. The 2S31 was to be more capable in the direct fire role, and more useful as an artillery piece.

The 2S31 is based on the chassis of the BMP-3 mechanized infantry combat vehicle. The driver is located at the front, the turret in the center, and the engine and drivetrain art located at the rear. The 2S31 features a high level of automation, an advanced fire control system, and an active protection system.


The 120mm 2A80 rifled gun/mortar is the main armament. It is longer than the 120mm gun/mortars found on the tracked 2S9 and wheeled 2S23. Although rifle, it can fire 120mm shells designed for smoothbore and rifled barrels. Laser-guided shells can also be fired. A total of 70 shells of 120mm ammunition are carried, about twice as many as carried by 2S9 or 2S23. The effective range is highly dependent on the type of ammunition. Regular shells can be fired out to 5 or 9 km. Assisted projectiles can be fired up to 13 or 17 km, depending on the type. The maximum rate of fire is quoted as 8 to 10 rpm.

The tracked chassis provides the 2S31 with good off-road mobility and the ability to keep up with mechanized infantry. The UTD-29 diesel engine provides up to 450 hp. The maximum speed is 70 km/h on roads. The 2S31 is amphibious and propelled in the water via a water jet.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, CFE Treaty, Russian Federation, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).

Here is Protection information for the 2S31 Vena Russian Amphibious 120mm Self-Propelled Mortar:
The Hull Armor is The hull of the 2S31 is built from aluminum (possibly the ABT-102 alloy from Nii Stali), which is then covered with bolt-on hardened steel armor. Without the steel, the aluminum protects against small arms fire and shell splinters, and the additional steel, which is concentrated on the front of the vehicle, is sufficient to stop 30 mm rounds fired at a range of 200 m..
The Turret Armor is The steel armor protects the crew from small arms fire and shells splinters..
The Applique Armor is The vehicles can be fitted with bar armour to provide statistical protection against cumulative projectiles or RPG-7 type weapons. There is an additional armour kit available that appears to add spaced modules to the sides of the hull. It is thought to extend protection to 25 mm rounds fired at the sides of the hull and include air pockets to retain the amphibious capabilities of the platform..
