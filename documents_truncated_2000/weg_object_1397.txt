This document describes the Novorossiysk Class (Project 636.3 Class) Russian Diesel-Electric Attack Submarine.

The NOVOROSSIYSK-class subs are an improved version of the Project 877 Kilo-class boats. The Project 636.3 configuration modifies the standard Project 636 Improved KILO-class subs, which have been exported. The subs are designed primarily for anti-shipping and anti-submarine missions in relatively shallow waters.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
