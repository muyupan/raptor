Here is Variants information for the 9P133 Russian 4x4 Amphibious Anti-Tank Guided Missile Carrier:
The BRDM-2 is basic reconnaissance vehicle, distinguished by its turret, which is the same as that mounted on the BTR-60PB. The conical turret, which mounts two machine guns (14.5 mm and 7.62 mm), is unusual in that it has no top hatch opening. This model carries a crew of four: the commander, the gunner, the driver, and the co-gunner. It also has a land navigation system that gives co-ordinate readings. Late Production version had mushroom-type vents on top of engine compartment. Final production model had two additional turret periscopes, one on top of turret and the other one on the left hand side of the turret and a TNA-2 navigation apparatus. It was also known under designations BTR-40PB, BTR-40P-2 and GAZ 41-08..
The BRDM-2RKh is BRDM-2RKh (khimicheskaya razvedivatel’naya mashina) – radiological-chemical reconnaissance vehicle with two KZO-2 rectangular dispensers for emplacing warning poles and flags around contaminated areas. The pole/flag dispensers are located on the rear corners of the vehicle's hull. The dispensers are normally covered with canvas and when required are positioned vertically over the rear of the vehicle. The specialized equipment consist of an automatic gas detector GSA-12, a dosimeter DP-5V, a röntgenmeter DP-3B, decontamination apparatus DK-4K and semi-automatic detection devices PPKhR and VPKhR. The vehicle retains the original armament. The regimental chemical defence platoon and the divisional-level chemical defence company use it, as the does divisional reconnaissance battalion. It was also known under designations BRDM-2RKhA, BTR-40P-2RKh and BTR-40PB-RKh..
The BRDM-2RKhb is BRDM-2RKhb – improved model that can also be used for biological reconnaissance, thanks to specialised equipment including the DP-5B röntgenmeter and biological aerosol detector ASP. BRDM-2RKhb doesn't have the firing ports. This model has twin 7.62 mm PKT general-purpose machine guns instead of the 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial general-purpose machine gun and usually carries only one KZO-2 dispenser. It was also known under designation BRDM-2RKhB..
The BRDM-2UM is BRDM-2UM (mashina upravleniya) – command vehicle without turret; however, it carries a 1 kW generator and extra radios (two R-123 and an R-107, or according to other sources one R-105M, one R-108M and one R-130M). On either side of the upper hull there is a big antenna base. Contrary to general Western belief, this is actually a very rare vehicle primarily built for export..

The 9P137 "Flejta" is 9P137 "Flejta" – improved model that uses the 9K8 "Flejta" system which allows usage of 9M19P ATGMs with SACLOS instead of MCLOS guidance. The launcher has 5 rails instead of 4..
The 9P148 "Konkurs" is 9P148 "Konkurs" – ATGM launcher vehicle with 5 wire-guided 9M113 "Konkurs" (AT-5 Spandrel). The AT-5 launcher can also fire the 9M111 "Fagot" (AT-4 Spigot) missile. The early production model of 9P148 could only fire 9M113 "Konkurs". The crew reloads the launcher through a small hatch located behind it. The gunner controls the missiles through a sight mounted on the front right of the vehicle. The 9P148 can carry a total of 10 9M111 and 10 9M113 or 14 9M113.

This system emits no radar energy but can detect radio waves emitted from aircraft, giving the vehicle warning about incoming aircraft and aiding in the acquisition of the target aircraft with the optical system. Typical tactics call for the launch of two missiles against each target to improve the chance of destroying it..
The ZS-82 is ZS-82 (zvukoveshchatel'naya stantsiya) – PsyOps vehicle with a large box speaker array on top of an unarmed turret..
