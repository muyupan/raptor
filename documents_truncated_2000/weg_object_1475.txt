This document describes the Kedah Class Malaysian New Generation Patrol Vessel (NGPV).

The KEDAH-class ocean patrol vessels are based on Germany's MEKO 100 design. Also known as the New Generation Patrol Vessel (NGPV) in Malaysia, the vessels utilize stealth designs to reduce radar cross-section. While their size and tonnage imply the Kedah-class ships to be corvettes, they are classified as offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) by the Royal Malaysian Navy, a category more common with law enforcement or coast guard vessels, not naval warships. This is rooted in the fact that the Kedah class was delivered in a condition named for but not with, meaning that certain weapon systems were not included in the original purchase, but all provisions to install and use them, including sensors and electronics, are already present in the ships. The weapons themselves can be easily "plugged in" with little delay as soon as the Royal Malaysian Navy has purchased them. These purchases however have not yet been made. Currently, the Kedah-class vessels are armed with guns only (76 mm gun on the bow, 30 mm gun on the aft), making them quite lightly armed and fairly vulnerable for naval ships of their size, thus justifying their listing as OPVs rather than proper corvettes.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Malaysia.
