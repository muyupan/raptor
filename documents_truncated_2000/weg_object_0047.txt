This document describes the ZTZ-96 (Type 96) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The ZTZ-96 (Type 96) Chinese Main Battle Tank (MBT) is the principle MBT of the PLA and represents China’s effort to bring the majority of its tanks up to a third-generation standard. It employs a 125 mm gun and autoloader as found on the T-72.
The Type 96 Main Battle Tank (MBT) was developed from the Type 85-III, which was mainly aimed at the export market. The Type 96 has some minor modifications. Sometimes it is referred to as the Type 88C or ZTZ96. It entered service with the Chinese army in 1997. It replaced in production the previous Type 88 MBT. Production of the original Type 96 ceased in 2005. It is estimated that over 1 500 of these main battle tanks were built. Other sources claim, that 2 000-2 500 of these tanks were produced. Currently, it is a mainstay of China's MBT fleet. These tanks are being gradually upgraded. The only export customer of this tank is Sudan.  The Type 96 MBT is armed with a fully stabilized 125 mm smoothbore gun, fitted with an autoloader. Both the gun and autoloader were copied from the Soviet T-72. This main battle tank might be compatible with the Russian AT-11 Sniper gun-launched anti-tank guided missiles, or its Chinese copy. The maximum rate of fire is 6-8 rounds per minute. A total of 42 rounds are carried.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Sudan.
