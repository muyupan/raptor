This document describes the M101A1 American 105mm Towed Howitzer.

M101A1 â€“ upgraded version, introduced in 1964. It has a modified carriage with a different shield.

The M101A1 105mm Light Howitzer, Towed is a general purpose, light field artillery weapon consisting of a cannon, 105mm howitzer (M2A2); recoil mechanism, M2 series; and carriage, 105mm Howitzer, M2A2. It can be used for direct or indirect fire. The cannon consists of a tube assembly, a breech ring, and a locking ring. The cannon is mounted on the recoil sleigh assembly. The firing mechanism is a continuous pull (self cocking) type activated by pulling a lanyard. The cannon is single-loaded, air-cooled, and uses semi-fixed ammunition. The carriage is of the single axle and split trail type. The trails are divided at emplacement but are drawn together and locked during travel. A drawbar is provided for securing a prime mover. The carriage consists of an equilibrator, shield, elevating mechanism, cradle, gear, elevating arcs, traversing mechanism, top carriage, wheels, and trails. The recoil mechanism is a constant hydropneumatic type shock absorber that decreases the energy of the recoil gradually and so avoids violent movement of the cannon or carriage. It is installed in the cradle of the carriage.

The M101 is The original production model had the M2A1 carriage and the M2A1 model gun, which had a straight barrel..
The M101A1 is This is covered in the main entry. It has a M2A2 carriage (which differs from the M2A1 chiefly in the amount of shielding) and the M2A2 gun, which has a thickened muzzle..
The German M101 modification is It features a longer barrel with single-baffle muzzle brake, new breech ring and new sights. Maximum range is 15,420 yds (14,100 m)..
The M101/33 Upgrade is This was proposed by RDM (De Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij BV) Defence Engineering of Rotterdam, Netherlands. It features a longer barrel of 33 calibers; progressive twist rifling increasing from 1 in 35 to 1 in 18 over the first 9 ft 2 in (2.974 m) and holding 1 in 18 over last 12 in (306 mm ); and a slotted muzzle brake. The loaded weight increases to 5,247 lb (2,380 kg).
In March 1994, RDM was awarded a US$13.75 million contract by the Canadian army to upgrade 96 M101 howitzers to the M101/33 standard. The contract included two options, one for an additional 29 howitzers, and another for an additional 60. The first upgraded howitzers were shipped back to Canada in late 1995 with the entire batch of 96 to be completed in 1998.

It was also trialed in Indonesia and Malaysia. In 1994, a single model of a Brazilian M101 was upgraded by RDM with a 37-caliber barrel from the Royal Ordnance L118 Light Gun. At the time, Brazil had a requirement for up to 80 upgraded M101s..
The M101/LG1 Upgrade is Giat Industries has developed an upgrade for the M101 that replaces the 23-caliber barrel of the M101 with the 30-caliber barrel used by Giat's LG1 Mk II 105-mm Light Gun. The upgrade allows the M101 to fire new Giat HE extended-range base-bleed ammunition out to 17,500 m (10.9 miles).
Giat was awarded a contract by the Philippines in July 1996 to modify 12 M101A1s with the newer barrel. An order for the rest of the Philippines inventory of M101s was seen as possible. Thailand reportedly ordered 300 upgraded kits for its stock of M101s..
