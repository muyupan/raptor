This document describes the Eridan Class French Minehunter.

In France the class is known as the Éridan class. Each hull was created from fibreglass, moulded in a steel shell. The hulls were 51.6 metres (169 ft 3 in) long overall with a beam of 8.9 metres (29 ft 2 in) and a draught of 3.8 metres (12 ft 6 in). The ships had a standard displacement of 571 tonnes (562 long tons) and 605 t (595 long tons) at full load. This later increased to 625 t (615 long tons) at full load. A 5.1 tonnes (5 long tons) container can be stored aboard the ships for additional supply room. The minehunters had an initial complement of 55, this was later reduced to 49.

The Éridan-class minehunters have two independent propulsion systems. In normal operations the minehunters are powered by a 1,400-kilowatt (1,900 bhp) Brons-Werkspoor (later Wärtsilä) A-RUB 215V-12 diesel engine turning one shaft with a LIPS controllable pitch propeller. Using the conventional system, the minehunters have a maximum speed of 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph) and a range of 3,000 nautical miles (5,600 km; 3,500 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph). For use when minehunting the vessels have two 180 kW (240 hp) ACEC active rudders and a bow thruster. These are energised by three Astazou IVB gas turbine alternators rated at 150 kW. A fourth diesel-driven alternator rated at 160 kW supplies power during normal operations. Both systems can be operated from the bridge or from a soundproof control centre above the main deck. The maximum speed using the minehunting propulsion system that can be achieved is 7 knots (13 km/h; 8.1 mph).

The minehunters were equipped with DUBM 21B sonar that could detect and classify ground and moored mines to a range of 80 metres (260 ft). The sonar was retracted during normal operations. The vessel was also equipped with Racal Decca 1229 radar. The vessels carried two ECA PAP 104 remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs). In 2001, the minesweepers underwent modernisation and the sonar was replaced with the TUS 2022 Mk III type, the radar with the Bridgemaster E250 type and a TSM 2061 combat data system and a Bofors Double Eagle Mk2 ROV were fitted.

The Éridan class is armed with one 20 mm modèle F2 gun capable of firing 720 rounds per minute to a range of 2 kilometres (1.2 mi). The minehunters also mount one 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine gun and two 7.62 mm (0.30 in) machine guns. The French vessels have limited minesweeping ability and were initially only fitted with mechanical sweep gear. In 1985, the Éridan class received AP4 acoustic sweep gear.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: France.
