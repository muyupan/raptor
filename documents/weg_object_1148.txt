This document describes the 9K317M Buk-M3 (SA-27) Russian Medium-Range Air Defense Missile System.

The Buk M3 (Beech M3) is a brand-new Russian air defense system. It uses new missiles and has advanced electronic components. It has much-improved capabilities compared with the older Buk systems. It outperforms even the old S-300P long-range air defense system. A single Buk-M3 complex (including several launch vehicles) is capable of engaging up to 36 different targets simultaneously from any angle, while a single fire-control radar is capable of supporting the engagement of up to 6 different targets simultaneously within a sector 120째 in azimuth and 85째 in elevation.

In terms of organization, one Buk-M3 brigade would be expected to consist of four "divisions" (approximately a battalion set), with a single 9S52 Polyana-D4 Brigade C2 or similar vehicle in control of all four "divisions". One "division" is typically composed of three batteries, with one command vehicle and one search radar vehicle responsible for three batteries. Each battery would be composed battery would consist of 2 launch vehicles. These launch vehicles can be either one 9A317M TELAR and a 9A316M TEL, or two 9A316M TELs and a single 9S36M illumination and guidance radar vehicle. It should be noted that "division" means 'division', but this measurement takes on a different meaning when dealing with Russian anti-air unit sets as opposed to personnel or armor formations, and so the term has been transliterated rather than translated to reflect this difference of meaning and avoid confusion. It is perhaps most accurately translated into English as a battalion set. The table below displays the principal vehicles known to be included within a "division" (battalion set):

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
