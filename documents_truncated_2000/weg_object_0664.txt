This document describes the Kh-38 (Kh-38M) Russian Air-to-Surface Missile.

The Kh-38/Kh-38M (Russian: Ð¥-38) is a family of air-to-surface missiles meant to succeed the Kh-25 family of missiles. The basic configuration of the Kh-38M was revealed at the 2007 Moscow Air Show (MAKS). The modular guided air-to-surface missile is meant to succeed the venerable Kh-25 missile family. The missile is designed to be carried by the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 fighter aircraft. The first prototypes of the missile had initially folding wings and tail fins for internal carriage, and would have a variety of seeker heads for different variants. In a successive version, unveiled at MAKS 2017, both control surfaces were replaced by longer and narrower fixed ones, a solution similar to the one used in the Selenia Aspide missile.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
