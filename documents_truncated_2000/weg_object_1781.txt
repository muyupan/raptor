This document describes the 9T452 Russian 8x8 Transloader Vehicle.

Each BM 9P140 launcher is normally accompanied by at least one and sometimes two,9T452 transloader vehicles based on the same ZIL-135LM 8 Ã— 8 chassis.

The transloader vehicle carries 16 reload rounds arranged in two stacks positioned one either side of the vehicle. Mounted to the immediate rear of the cab is a hydraulic crane operated by one person, which is used to resupply the rocket launcher. This crane has a maximum lifting weight of 300 kg with the operator being seated to the rear.

For reloading, the launcher has to be in the horizontal position and traversed to one side. The new rocket is then loaded into the tube via the crane and rammed home by the rammer.
