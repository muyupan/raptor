This document describes the Cakra 401 Class Indonesian Diesel-Electric Submarine.

These submarines are the 1300 design of the widely used German Type 209 attack submarines; they were designed by the IKL firm in Lubeck and constructed in Germany. The subs were ordered on April 2, 1977.
CAKRA and NANGGALA finished refits in 1987 and 1989, respectively. CAKRA was again refitted between June 1993 and June 1997; NANGGALA also received another refit between October 1997 and mid-1997. During these refits, both boats received new batteries and an improved combat data system.

Both were refitted again by Daewoo Shipbuilding, South Korea -- CAKRA in 2004/2005. NANGGALA's was completed in April 2006. During the latter refits, both received new batteries, had their engines overhauled and their combat data systems modernized.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Indonesia.
