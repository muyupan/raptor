This document describes the S-400 Triumph (SA-21 Growler) Russian Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System.

The S-400 name refers to a family of long-range air defense systems. The system family is only thought to have a domestic and an export variant, and only the former is treated as its own system of systems within this record, due to a lack of confirmed information relating to the export variant. The S-400 was originally conceived in the Soviet Union during the 1980s, as a replacement for the S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna series of SAM systems. It was intended as a multifunctional long-range air-defense system that would form the upper level of the Russian multi-layer air and ballistic missile defense system. The S-400 system has entered service with only two users outside of Russia (China and Turkey), and due to its formidable capabilities to shift the balance of air power to regions where it is deployed, its sale is often accompanied by significant controversy.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belarus, China, India, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Turkey.
