This document describes the 9K388 Igla-S (SA-24 Grinch) Russian Man-Portable Air-Defense Missile.

The Igla man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) are one of the best-selling arms. This system belongs to the second-generation MANPADS meeting the most stringent requirements to combat effectiveness in a harsh jamming environment. In 2004 the Russian army adopted the new MANPADS - Igla-S (sometimes called "Igla-Super") which is much more sophisticated and efficient in countering air threats. Serial production of the "Igla-S" ("Needle-S") portable antiaircraft missile complex (PAAMC) is conducted at the Degtyarev factory in the city of Kovrov. This newest PAAMC was awarded the State premium.

The "Igla-S" PAAMC by its capabilities is significantly superior to the "Igla" PAAMC, which entered service in 1983. The "Igla-S" tactical and technical characteristics enable it to destroy targets at altitudes up to 5-7 km. The limiting altitude of effective target destruction for the "Igla-S" complex is 3.5 km, according to Deputy Director-General of the enterprise Vasily Russu. According to him, foreign customers also display serious interest in the "Igla-S" PAAMC.



This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Libya, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Syria, Thailand, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam.
