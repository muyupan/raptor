This document describes the K12 South Korean 7.62mm General-Purpose Machine Gun.

S&T Motiv K12 is a 7.62×51mm NATO machine gun manufactured by S&T Daewoo to replace M60 machine gun for Republic of Korea Armed Forces. The XK12 was first shown to the public in 2009, during the Seoul ADEX International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition.

The K12 is based on the K3's design, layout, and function using a gas piston and rotating bolt. It is fed through a STANAG M13 disintegrating belt link and cannot accept a magazine. The cross-bolt type safety is the same as K3/Minimi, and the receiver is made from steel press with an aluminum alloy feed cover. Although similar in design, the receiver and other important parts are enlarged to accommodate the larger round.

The K12 is somewhat heavy for the gun class at 12 kg (26 lb), mainly because it has pistol grip, spade grip, and metal sliding stock all in one gun for the purpose of being quickly converted into a ground-fire machine gun by a dismounted operator; the spade grip can be removed by taking out two pins, removing the grip, and unfolding the stock which is similar in design to the FN Minimi's Para version. Standard machine gun features are included like a folding (K3-style) bipod, quick change barrel, gas regulator, and (M240H-style) flash suppressor. It also has a folding ring sight for firing on helicopters with a folding ladder type sight for more accurate aiming.

The sight is attached on a MIL-STD 1913 rail, which is also on the feed cover and both sides of the handguard. No laser or optical sight has yet been selected for use on the K12, but some kind of electro-optical accessories are expected in the near future.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: South Korea (Republic of Korea).
