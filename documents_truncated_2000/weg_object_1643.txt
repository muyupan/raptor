This document describes the Admiral Grigorovich-Class (Project 11356 Class) Russian Frigate.

Admiral Grigorovich-Class (Project 11356 Class) Russian Frigate is a class of frigates built by the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad for the Russian Navy. Based on the Talwar class, six ships were ordered for the Russian Black Sea Fleet under two contracts in 2010 and 2011 as a complement to the Admiral Gorshkov class frigates.

By 2010-2011, it was decided the Russian Navy will procure six vessels based on the proven Talwar class design, mainly due to repeated delays with the production of Admiral Gorshkov frigates and because of the urgent need for new frigates necessary for the modernization of the Black Sea Fleet. The Yantar Shipyard won the contract for the construction of the frigates and three vessels were to be completed in four years. Previously, six ships of the same design, known as Talwar class, were built for the Indian Navy between 1999 and 2011 by the Baltic Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, and Yantar Shipyard, Kaliningrad.

The lead ship, Admiral Grigorovich, was laid down on 18 December 2010 and was commissioned on 11 March 2016.

Initially, Ukrainian state-owned enterprise Zorya-Mashproekt was providing gas turbines for the Russian frigates, but after the Ukrainian crisis, Ukraine said it would no longer supply the engines. Instead, Russian manufacturer, Saturn was asked to supply alternative M90FR gas turbines.

Since October 2016, it was claimed the three incomplete frigates, Admiral Butakov, Admiral Istomin, and Admiral Kornilov, that construction was suspended in 2015 due to Ukraine's refusal to supply gas turbine power plants, are considered to be sold to India. The Russian Navy has opposed this export.


On 1 June 2017, the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) announced that it would resume construction of the last three frigates in 2018 and that the ships will later join the Russian Navy. The decision to resume the work was made following the preliminary testing of the latest Russian gas turbine engines, the M70FRU (14 MW), M70FRU2 (6-8 MW), and M90FR (20 MW , maximal 25-28 MW), from the United Engine Corporation, built at NPO Saturn and TurboRus plants. With access to alternative power plants, the ships were believed to remain in Russian service.

However, on 27 October 2018, India's Ministry of Defence and Russia signed a US$950 million deal for the delivery of two incomplete Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates to the Indian Navy. Reportedly, these are to be Admiral Butakov and Admiral Istomin frigates, previously being built for the Russian Navy.

As of February 2019, the last three vessels remain without engines.

On 3 November 2016, as part of Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, Admiral Grigorivich was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for the first time. On 15 November 2016, it has launched a Kalibr cruise missile on IS and Al-Nusra targets in Syria's Idlib and Homs provinces, destroying ammunition warehouses, gathering and training centers, and weapon production plants.

Admiral Grigorivich was redeployed to the Mediterranean Sea in April 2017, following the US missile strikes against Syria.

On 20 November 2018, Rosoboronexport and Goa Shipyard signed a US$500 million deal for the construction of additional two Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates for the Indian Navy. The frigates are to be licensed-built at the Goa Shipyard in India under a technology transfer from Russia. The construction is expected to start in 2020, with the first vessel to be delivered in 2026 and the second in 2027.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: India, Russian Federation.

Here is Weapon Station #3 information for the Admiral Grigorovich-Class (Project 11356 Class) Russian Frigate of the Armament:
The Name is 2 x Kashtan CIWS.
The Type is Close-in weapon system (CIWS) is a modern naval air defence gun-missile system deployed by the Russian Navy.
The Caliber is 30 mm.
The Barrel Length is INA.
The Main Armament is 8 × 9M311K + 32 missiles.
The Secondary Armament is 2 × AO-18K autocannon.
The Barrels is 2 × 6 (guns); 2 × 4 launch tubes.
The Height is 2,250 mm (above deck).
The Weight is 15,500 kg.
The Action is Gas-operated rotary cannon.
The Rate of Fire is 9,000 rounds/min;
1–2 (salvo) missiles per 3–4 sec..
The Muzzle Velocity is 860 m/s.
The Effective Firing Range is By missiles: Kashtan:
1,500–8,000 m..
The Feed System is Link-less, helical; 1000 rounds.
The Sights is Radar / TV-optical.
The Warhead is Continuous-rod w/ frag layer.
The Note is The weapon is a modular system consisting of a command module and typically two combat modules, as in the case of the two Sovremennyy-class destroyers Taizhou (ex-Vnushitelnyy) and Ningbo (ex-Vechnyy) in Chinese service, although the number can be as many as 8 in the case of Admiral Kuznetsov. The command module detects and tracks threats, distributes targeting data to the combat modules, and interrogates IFF of approaching threats. The command module has a 3-D target detection radar, and an all weather multi-band integrated control system. Depending on the number of installed combat modules, the system can engage multiple targets simultaneously. The combat modules automatically track using either radar, electro-optronic control system (such as FLIRs) or both, and then engages targets with missiles and guns. The combat modules are typically equipped with two GSh-30K (AO-18K) six-barrel 30 mm rotary cannons, fed by a link-less feeding mechanism, and two 9M311-1 missile launchers equipped with 4 ready-to-fire missiles each and fed by a reloading system storing 32 missiles in ready-to-launch containers.

The guns used in the Kortik are the GSh-30K six-barrel 30 mm rotary cannon. Individually, each GSh-30K has a higher rate of fire compared to other guns used by other CIWS such as the GAU-8 on the Goalkeeper and the M61 Vulcan on the Phalanx. Along with a high rate of fire, the fairly heavy round (390 g or 14 oz) used by the Kortik is comparable to the DPU rounds of the GAU-8 Avenger (425 g or 15.0 oz), although the muzzle velocity (and therefore both the kinetic energy and effective range) is slightly lower, partially offsetting the high caliber and rate of fire.

The missiles used in the Kortik are the 9M311 missiles, which is also used on the 9K22 Tunguska. The 9M311 is a SACLOS guided missile, however, it is steered automatically by the command module. The warhead weighs 9 kilograms (20 lb) and is either laser or radio fused. The warhead is a continuous-rod warhead with a steel cube fragmentation layer. The detonation of the warhead will form a complete circle of fragmentation that is 5 meters in radius, and damage or destroy anything in that circle.

The combination of the missiles and guns, provides more comprehensive protection when compared to other CIWS utilising either missiles or guns only. The system's combined kill probability is 0.96 to 0.99.
The Flight Altitude is 3,500 m.
