This document describes the MiG-29 (Fulcrum) Russian Multirole Fighter Aircraft.

The Mikoyan MiG-29 (Russian: Микоян МиГ-29; NATO reporting name: Fulcrum) is a twin-engine jet fighter aircraft designed in the Soviet Union. Developed by the Mikoyan design bureau as an air superiority fighter during the 1970s, the MiG-29, along with the larger Sukhoi Su-27, was developed to counter new U.S. fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The MiG-29 entered service with the Soviet Air Forces in 1982.

While originally oriented towards combat against any enemy aircraft, many MiG-29s have been furnished as multirole fighters capable of performing a number of different operations, and are commonly outfitted to use a range of air-to-surface armaments and precision munitions. The MiG-29 has been manufactured in several major variants, including the multirole Mikoyan MiG-29M and the naval Mikoyan MiG-29K; the most advanced member of the family to date is the Mikoyan MiG-35. Later models frequently feature improved engines, glass cockpits with Hands-On-Throttle-and-Stick (HOTAS) flight controls, modern radar and infrared search and track (IRST) sensors, and considerably increased fuel capacity; some aircraft have also been equipped for aerial refueling.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the militaries of a number of former Soviet republics have continued to operate the MiG-29, the largest of which is the Russian Air Force. The MiG-29 has also been a popular export aircraft; more than 30 nations either operate or have operated the aircraft to date.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bulgaria, CFE Treaty, Chad, Cuba, Eritrea, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Peru, Poland, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United States of America, Uzbekistan.

Here is Variants information for the MiG-29 (Fulcrum) Russian Multirole Fighter Aircraft:
