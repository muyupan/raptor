This document describes the 3M55 Oniks Russian Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile.

3M55 Oniks – Base version for Russia.

The P-800 Oniks (Russian: П-800 Оникс; English: Onyx), also known in export markets as Yakhont (Russian: Яхонт; English: ruby), is a Soviet / Russian supersonic anti-ship cruise missile developed by NPO Mashinostroyeniya as a ramjet version of P-80 Zubr. Its GRAU designation is 3M55, the air launched Kh-61 variant also exists. The missile has the NATO reporting codename SS-N-26 "Strobile". Development officially started in 1983, and in the 1990s the anti-ship missile was tested on the Project 1234.7 ship. In 2002 the missile passed the whole range of trials and was commissioned. It is reportedly a replacement of the P-270 Moskit, but possibly also of the P-700 Granit. The P-800 was used as the basis for the joint Russian-Indian supersonic missile BrahMos. The missile is carried in flight by aerodynamic lift. The solid-propellant booster is located in the ramjet's combustion chamber and is ejected by the airflow after it has burned out.

Advantages
*Over-the-horizon firing range
*Full autonomy of combat use ("fire and forget")
*A set of flexible ("low-profile sea-skimming", "high-low") trajectories
*High supersonic speed in all phases of flight
*Full harmonization for a wide range of platforms (surface ships, submarines and land-based 
 launchers)
* Possible use of the missile in electronic countermeasures environment and under enemy fire

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Indonesia, Russian Federation, Syria, Viet Nam.
