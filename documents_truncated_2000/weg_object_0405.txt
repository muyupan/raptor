This document describes the Hwasong-13 (KN-08) North Korean Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile.

The Hwasong-13 (Korean: 화성 13호; Hanja: 火星 13号; lit. Mars-13), also known as Rodong-C (Korean: 로동-시; Hanja: 勞動-C) or KN-08 under the U.S. naming convention,[3] is a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile believed to be under development by North Korea. The changes shown in the mock-up displayed in October 2015 indicated a change from a three to two-stage design.

Mock-ups of the missile were first displayed during a military parade in April 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of Kim Il Sung. Six missiles were carried on 16-wheel transporter erector launchers (TEL), similar in size to those used by the Russian RT-2PM2 Topol-M missiles. The TELs are thought to be based on WS-51200 frames made by Wanshan Special Vehicle in China, possibly using technology from Minsk Automobile Plant. UN investigators have concluded that the TELs were Chinese WS51200 trucks exported to North Korea for lumber transport. The North Koreans converted them into TELs by installing hydraulic gear and controls to erect a missile. Despite being converted to fire a missile, the truck would not be likely to survive damage from the rocket exhaust like a purpose-built TEL, making it a single-use launcher.

Mock-ups were again paraded in 2013, with fewer discrepancies between them than in the previous year. The KN-08 was paraded again to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of Korean Workers Party on 11 October 2015. In this parade, the missile featured a modified smaller-in-length but larger-in-diameter third stage plus re-entry vehicle section design, which has led to suggestions that North Korea might have perfected nuclear warhead miniaturization.

The KN-08 mock-up dimensions are estimated to be: length of about 17.1 metres, and first and second stage diameter of about 1.9 metres, reducing to about 1.25 metres for the third stage. Liquid-fueled ICBMs generally only have two stages for best performance, with a few exceptions (usually when an existing design is upgraded). The three stage design of the KN-08 is puzzling.[20] While a three-stage design is common for solid propellant ICBMs, western analysts say that North Korea lacks the experience and ability to develop a solid-fueled ICBM.

In early 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that although they had not seen the KN-08 tested, they believed North Korea had the ability to put a nuclear weapon on a KN-08, and it was prudent to plan for that threat. The KN-08 theoretically poses a threat to the U.S. mainland, able to deliver a 500–700 kg (1,100–1,500 lb) payload 7,500–9,000 km (4,700–5,600 mi) to the American West Coast. Practically speaking however, its accuracy is likely "barely adequate" to target large cities, mobility would be limited to paved roads, and the system will require 1–2 hours of pre-launch fueling. In 2017, speculations were published, that the KN-08 may achieve an emergency operational status by 2020

It is reported on December 2, 2017, that the missile was canceled and that development team was sent to assist development of Hwasong-12 IRBM, Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 ICBMs. German analyst Norbert Brugge in interview on November 27, 2017 for Difesa Online, a military focused website claimed that Hwasong-10 and Hwasong-13 were likely canceled due to inability to solve engine problems.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).

Here is Variants information for the Hwasong-13 (KN-08) North Korean Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile:
The KN-14 (KN-08 Mod 2) is This is an upgraded variant. It has two stages and a blunt, cone-shaped nose. First revealed on Oct. 10, 2015, it is believed to have a smaller warhead capability and shorter range. The KN-14 is thought to be road-mobile, similar to the KN-08.
 
Later analysis has suggested this is a new missile, which has been designated the KN-20 (Hwasong-14)..

Here is Dimensions information for the Hwasong-13 (KN-08) North Korean Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile:
The Missile Length is 17.5 m to 19.75 m.
The Missile Diameter 1st to 2nd Stage is 1.8 m to  2.00 m.
The Missile Diameter 3rd Stage is 1.25 m.
