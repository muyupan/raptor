This document describes the SNAR-10M1 (Big Fred) Russian Battlefield Surveillance Radar.

The SNAR-10M1 variant is a widely deployed battlefield surveillance "Big Fred" radar system, mounted on a self-propelled armored vehicle. It is designed to locate stationary and moving targets at the forward edge of the battle area. The radar operates at a frequency of about 35 GHz and is capable of scanning the terrain in both a horizontal and vertical mode. This is done by tipping the antenna, thereby overseeing a large area. The dipping antenna is designated as the IRL-127-1.

The SNAR-10 M1 self-propelled radar, capable of detecting tanks at a distance of up to 40 km, arrived at the Central Military District under a state defense order. The new station strengthens the combat capabilities of the artillery units of the tank formation stationed in the South Urals. The SNAR-10 M1 radar is designed for reconnaissance of moving ground, air, and surface targets. The modern radar can detect vehicles, manpower, exploding shells at a range of 200m - 40km. The station is equipped with an internal and external communication system with automated data transmission, and satellite navigation. Autonomous operation of the complex is at least three days. The crew is four people strong. The radar can be deployed into combat position in max 5 minutes.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, CFE Treaty, Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Ukraine.
