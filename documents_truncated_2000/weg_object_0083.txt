This document describes the 2S1 (Gvozdika) Russian 122mm Amphibious Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

Hezbollah Proliferation. The 2S1 Gvozdika (Carnation) is a 122 mm self-propelled howitzer designed and manufactured in the Soviet era to provide mechanized forces with an integral artillery asset that could be used to influence a battlefield close to the front line and reduce reliance on divisional assets. While the design is old and its 122 mm gun lacks the range of modern howitzers, the system remains in service with multiple users.

The 2S1 is mounted on a modified MT-LB chassis. It is used in mechanized formations to provide indirect- and direct-fire support during offensive operations. The vehicles are used by Russia’s regular and Arctic formations, the latter indicates that the vehicles can be fitted with the wider tracks and heaters used on the MT-LBV. The system usually operates as part of a six-man section, this includes the four crew members in the vehicle and two additional loaders that operate from a separate ammunition carrier. This is the preferred method of operation for the vehicle during sustained periods of combat.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, CFE Treaty, Congo, Croatia, Cuba, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Finland, Georgia, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, Myanmar, Non-State Actors, Poland, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, Yemen.
