This document describes the T-43 Class Albanian Minesweeper.

The T43 class were a group of minesweepers built for the Soviet Navy and Soviet allies in the 1950s and 1960s. The Soviet designation was Project 254.

The design specification was issued in 1946 and the design was approved in 1948. The ships were built with steel hulls which were degaussed but no specific attempt was made to reduce electrical or acoustic signature. Several versions were produced:

*Project 254 K (1952)- new MT-2 minesweeping gear, fitted with radar
*Project 254 M (1955)- deep mechanical sweep, acoustic and magnetic sweeps, more modern ASW mortars, 25mm guns replace 12.7mm machine guns, variable-pitch propellers
*Project 245 A (1957) - provided with NBC protection, with pressurised central space to keep out fall out
*Project 254 PGR (sometimes referred to as Project 254 V) - KVN-50 class radar picket ship fitted with a Knife Rest or Big Net radar installation - 20 conversions from 1956
*Project 258 (1956) - KVN-6 class radar picket ship fitted with Kaktus radar or later (Project 258M) modified with Rubka radar - 14 conversions from 1977
*Project 513 - patrol boat for the Border Guard
