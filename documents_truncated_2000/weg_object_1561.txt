This document describes the Type 072 Class (Yukan Class) Chinese Landing Ship.

The Type 072 landing ship (NATO designation Yukan class) are large landing ships built by Shanghai-based Zhonghua Shipyard (now Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding) in the 1980s to replace the aging World War II-era ex-US Navy L-1511 tank landing ships in service with the PLA Navy. The Type 072 is the PLA Navy’s first indigenous large landing ship. A total of 3 Type 072 are in service all of them are in service with the East Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN ESF).

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

The Name is Type 66 dual-57mm Naval Gun.
The Type is Naval Gun.
The Caliber is 57 mm.
The Quantity is 4 x Type 66 dual-57mm Naval Guns.
The Note is The AK-257 is a Soviet 57mm naval gun, originally a land ZIF-31 L/70 57mm (Type 66/76) cannon. During the early 1950s, development began of naval versions of the 57x348mmSR 70 calibre weapon which had entered service with the Soviet army in 1950 as the S-60. This was to be a supplementary weapon for larger warships and as the main gun armament for minesweepers and auxiliaries.

The twin gun version, ZIF-31, appears to have entered service with the Project 264 Minesweepers (T58 class) and the Project 310 (Don class) submarine support ships in 1958. In 1960, two other versions of the mounting appeared; a single gun ZIF-71 for the modernised Skoryy class destroyers and the quad ZIF-75 for the Krupny/Kanin class destroyers. The ZIF designation is an industrial one and it is possible that the naval designations were AK-157 (ZIF-71), AK-257 (ZIF-31) and AK-457 (ZIF-75). In smaller warships these mountings were sometimes associated with MR-103 and in larger ones with the Yakhond (Hawk Screech) radar. The ZIF-31/71/75 mountings may not have been very successful and an improved twin mounting appeared shortly afterwards as the AK-725. The twin 57mm ZIF-31 has also been manufactured in China as the Type 66 and there is a water-cooled derivative known as the Type 76. The AK-257 is currently employed on the Grisha class Corvette..
