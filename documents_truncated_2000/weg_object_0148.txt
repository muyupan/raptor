This document describes the 30N6E2 (Tombstone) Russian 3-D Long-Range Surveillance Radar.

The 64N6 (NATO codename 'Tombstone') 3-D long-range surveillance radar comprises a hydraulically raised antenna assembly and radar shelter mounted on a common semi-trailer. The phased-array antenna set has a double-sided antenna aperture. Its 3-D performance is obtained by rotation of the antenna once every 12 seconds and electronically scanning the antenna beam, in both azimuth and elevation. Scan sector capability for detecting tactical ballistic missiles is also provided. This can detect aircraft and cruise missile type targets at a range of up to 300 km and ballistic missiles with launching ranges of up to 1,000 km using the sector scan facility. An IFF transponder subsystem is fitted. The radar is used for target detection and tracking in normal, clutter and severe ECM environments. The data obtained are relayed to the command post for processing and assessment. The radar can detect targets with speeds of up to 2,788 m/s (10,000 km/h). The export designation of the system is 83M6E. The S-300PMU-2 system designation is 83M6E2.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, China, Russian Federation.
