NTC VISMOD 9A51 Prima Russian 122mm Multiple Rocket Launcher System
The Prima multiple launch rocket system is an improvement of the BM-21 Grad. It was adopted by the Soviet Army in 1988, however due to budget cuts, only a small number of these artillery systems were ever produced. Some sources claim that it is also in service with Kazakhstan. The Prima MLRS is also referred to as the 9K59, the launching vehicle is 9A51. It has 50 tubes for 122mm rockets. The older Grad has 40 tubes. It can fire all of the rockets developed for the BM-21 Grad, including cluster rockets with anti-tank or anti-personnel sub-munitions. Furthermore, new and more effective rockets have been developed for this system. The new 9M53F rocket with a separable HE-FRAG warhead is standard for this artillery system. The maximum range of fire is 21km. This and other new rockets can also be fired from improved Grad launchers. Rockets can be launched directly from the driver's cab or remotely from the vehicle. A full salvo of the Prima has 7-8 times better coverage and it spends 4-5 times less time in its firing position compared to the Grad.
