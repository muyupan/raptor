This document describes the GMZ-3 Russian Tracked Minelaying Vehicle.

The GMZ-3 tracked mine-laying vehicle is designed to lay antitank mines in the progress of action in the soil (snow) with their concealment and on the surface of the soil (snow) without concealment.

Mines are laid by being automatically delivered from the cluster to the dispersing mechanism and then through ports in the rear plate of the vehicle hull to the conveyer, which is provided with a mechanism that arms the moving mines. When mines are laid on the ground (snow) surface, they are dispersed directly from the conveyer. When mines are laid with concealment, they are dispersed through the plow assembly and laid in a furrow made by the plow; after a delay they are finally armed. Mines laid in loose soils (snow) are concealed by back dumps

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Russian Federation, Ukraine.
