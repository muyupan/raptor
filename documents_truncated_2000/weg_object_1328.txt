This document describes the Type 87 Japanese Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun (SPAAG).

The Type 87 Self Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun (SPAAG) of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) is designed and built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Tokyo, Japan as a replacement for the U.S. M42 Duster SPAAG. Japan Steel Works manufactures the KDA twin 35-mm gun system under a license from Contraves Oerlikon. 
 
The Type 87 SPAAG is built on a modified Type 74 chassis. The Type 74 MBT turret is removed and replaced with a two-man power operated turret that is fitted with twin 35-mm Oerlikon Contraves 35-mm KDA Cannons. It is also equipped with a tracking and surveillance radar located on the rear of the turret.

The Type 87 can be aimed and fired by way of an advanced optical sighting system or automatically by locking onto the target with the radar. The Type 87 SPAAG is paired with the 4 wheel trailer mounted Super Fledermaus Fire Control Radar.

The crew consists of 3 (commander, driver, and gunner). The driver's station is located at the front left side of the hull. Both the commander and gunner occupies positions side by side in the turret. The engine compartment is located at the rear of the SPAAG. 

A typical engagement is a 28 round burst.

The Type 87 SPAAG is capable of fording water at a depth of 2.0 meters when equipped with a drum-type extension collar above the commander's hatch and two thin extensions to the exhaust pipes.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Japan.
