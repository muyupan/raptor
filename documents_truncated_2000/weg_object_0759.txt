This document describes the Mini Harpy Israeli Tactical Loitering Munition Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

Mini-Harpy 
This tactical loitering munition combines the operating characteristics of the Harpy and Harop. It can lock onto radar and other emitting threats via person-in-the-loop electro-optical guidance. Fully autonomous operation is available as an option. It can attack emitting and non-emitting targets. Provides tactical forces with the ability to suppress the area of interest for long duration and to strike immediately emitting and non-emitting Targets.

The ability to seek and to attack any target from any direction at any angle, gives the Mini HARPY significant advantage in any environment. In addition, long-range communication, long-endurance of loitering time and a deadly warhead enables it to deal with diverse targets in the modern warfare.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Israel, Turkey.

Here is Variants information for the Mini Harpy Israeli Tactical Loitering Munition Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV):
The Cutlass is This variant of the Harpy was evaluated in 1999 with Raytheon for search-and-destroy missions and the ability to attack a wider range of targets. It would have been a sea-launched weapon employing advanced sensors from Raytheon.
The Harop/Harpy 2 is This is a larger, upgraded variant. Designed as a fire-and-forget weapon, the Harop can fly more than 600 mi (1,000 km) to patrol a specific area and attack any hostile radars detected..
The Harpy NG (new generation) is This is an upgraded variant that uses the Harop airframe. It was developed to counter newer air defense radar threats..
The Mini-Harpy is This tactical loitering munition combines the operating characteristics of the Harpy and Harop. It can lock onto radar and other emitting threats via person-in-the-loop electro-optical guidance. Fully autonomous operation is available as an option. It can attack emitting and non-emitting targets..
The Maritime Harop is This is a variant of the Harop optimized for operation from naval vessels, from patrol ships to frigates. It features a maritime-configured launcher and modified communications..
The ASN-301 is This is a Chinese copy of the Harpy. It has a delta wing and pusher propeller configuration that appears virtually identical to the Israeli system. According to the China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corp. (CATIC), the ASN-301 targets radar frequencies in the 2-16 GHz range and has a radar search range of 16 mi (25 km). The system is said to be able to target up to eight preset radar targets..
