This document describes the Type 051G Class (Luda III Class) Chinese Destroyer.

The Type 051G Class (Luda III Class) Chinese Destroyer was an improved variant that the last two ships, Zhanjiang and Zhuhai, were completed too. They were equipped with Type 354 3-D air and surface search radar. Four twin YJ-8 launchers replaced the HY-1/HY-2 launchers. The Soviet sonar was replaced by French DUBV-23 search sonar and DUBV-43 variable depth sonar (VDS).

Zhuhai was modified in 1999. The Soviet 130 mm guns were replaced by 100 mm (4 in) guns, derived from French Creusot-Loire Compact, with automated reloaders. An HQ-7 SAM launcher replaced the "X" turret, as on the Type 051DT. Zhuhai was similarly modified.

Zhanjiang and Zhuhai were equipped with the ZKG-4A and ZKG-4B combat data systems respectively.

The Type 051G was also the first Chinese ship to deploy the YU-7 lightweight torpedo and the Italian 40 mm (1.6 in) anti-aircraft gun.

The Type 051G was part of the Luda III class, and later the Luda IV class.

Note: There are no longer any Type 051 Class, Luda II Class, Type 051D Class, Type 051Z Class, or Type 051DT Class Chinese Destroyers left in active service.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
