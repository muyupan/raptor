This document describes the Scanter 5000 Series Danish Surveillance Radar.

The Scanter 5000 series is an X-band, 2D, pulse compression radar, using solid state transmitter technology with software-defined functionality. This system can be used for tracking vessels and coastal surveillance applications.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Norway, Singapore, Spain.

Here is Variants information for the Scanter 5000 Series Danish Surveillance Radar:
The SCANTER 5502 is System features include:
•	Doppler enhanced processing (MTI) 
•	Pulse compression 
•	Open system architecture 
•	Programmable Tx power levels 
•	Complaint to IALA V.128 for VTS 
•	Frequency and time diversity and multiple sub-bands 
•	Solid state power amplifier (SSPA). 
In 2016 Terma introduced an anti-icing antenna to mitigate the risk of ice building up on antennas, which rotate at 60 rotations per minute..
The SCANTER 5202 is This system can detect and track small remotely piloted or ultra-light aircraft operating near wind farms. If mounted on top of turbines, SCANTER sensors mitigate the need for multiple sensors to be installed on the wind farm's perimeter..
