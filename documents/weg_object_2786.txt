This document describes the PC360LC-11 Japanese Large Size Hydraulic Excavator.

PC360LC -11

Power and Performance
Powered by a Komatsu SAA6D114E-6 Tier 4 Final certified engine, featuring an integrated diesel particulate filter, hydraulically actuated Komatsu Variable Geometry Turbocharger, and Selective Catalytic Reduction system.

Large counterweight and robust undercarriage provide solid over the side stability while lifting.

Reduced cooled exhaust gas recirculation rate and advanced engine timing improve combustion efficiency and engine response.

High performance final drive assemblies provide high drawbar pull for improved steering performance and maneuverability.

Advanced Hydraulic System
New hydraulic pump control logic provides up to 4% increased performance compared to the PC360LC-10.

High displacement hydraulic pumps provide high flow rates at reduced engine RPM for improved fuel efficiency.

A Closed Center Load Sensing hydraulic system ensures smooth operation, quick cycle times, and great multi-function while lowering fuel consumption.

Efficiency is further improved with a quick arm return valve and by reducing hydraulic loss within the control valve and hydraulic circuit.

Enhanced Cab and Monitor Panel
The large quiet reinforced cab has an integrated ROPS design.

A high capacity operator seat comes standard with an air suspension and is heated for improved comfort.

The LCD color monitor panel has an updated screen that combines a rear view camera display together with key gauges and information.

Attachment control stores up to 10 work tools and the machine can run attachments while operating in Economy mode to save fuel.

A rear view monitoring system with one camera is standard and allows the operator to view directly behind the machine.

Simple and Convenient Maintenance
Serviceability is enhanced for simplicity and convenience to make sure it gets done.

Left and right guardrails on the upper structure to provide a convenient work area in front of the engine.

A battery disconnect switch cuts power to the machine during service or electrical work.

Service points are grouped for convenience and filters are accessible from ground level.

Maintenance intervals are monitored and stored in the large monitor panel.

Reliable Machine Design
All major components are designed and manufactured by Komatsu which allows the engine and hydraulic systems to be optimized to maximize efficiency.

A high efficiency dual element fuel filter and pre-filter with water separator provides engine protection from fuel contaminants.

Triple labyrinth final drive seal shields provide improved durability and floating seal protection.

The work equipment features large and durable one piece steel castings in the boom foot, boom tip, and arm tip.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Australia, Japan, United States of America.
