This document describes the 2A65 Msta-B (M1976) Russian 152mm Towed Gun Howitzer.

The Russian Msta-B type classified as M1976 and also designated 2A65, is a 152 mm towed howitzer developed towards the end of the Cold War for the Soviet forces. The Msta-B’s 2A65 ordnance is mounted on a conventional split trail carriage. When deployed in the firing position, the howitzer rests on three points – the hydraulic circular firing jack under the forward part of the carriage and the two spades at the rear, with the roadwheels raised from the ground. Each of the box section trails has a castor wheel to assist the gun crew in bringing the weapon into action. When deployed in the firing position, these swing upwards through 180° and rest on top of each trail. This is the same 152-mm weapon as the 2S19 on a two-wheel towed carriage with split trails. The towed gun preceded the 2S19 into production. The towed, nuclear-capable 152-mm field gun M1976, along with its self-propelled counterpart 2S5, replaced the 130-mm field gun M-46 in gun battalions organic to artillery regiments and brigades at the front and army level. This gun has a distinctive four-wheeled carriage and has an armored shield that slopes to the rear and extends over the wheels. It has been fielded since 1978 and deployed in Soviet forces in Eastern Europe. This deployment indicated the importance Soviet doctrine placed on the capability to deliver low-yield nuclear strikes relatively close to Soviet forces.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belarus, CFE Treaty, Georgia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine.
