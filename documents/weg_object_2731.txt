This document describes the FAUN BKF 35-4 German 35 Ton Mobile Recovery Crane.

The FAUN BKF 35-4 is an unusual German military machine. It is referred in German as Bergekranfahrzeug or recovery crane. It is fitted with specialized equipment for craning, winching, towing and recovery operations. This concept of a highly mobile recovery crane is specific to the German army, as other countries do not use such vehicles and rely either on mobile cranes or recovery vehicles. The FAUN BKF 35-4 was produced in the early 2000s. Deliveries commenced between 2002-2004, depending on the source. Some sources report that only 2 of these recovery cranes were ordered. At the time these were the biggest recovery vehicles in German army service.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Australia, Germany, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America.
