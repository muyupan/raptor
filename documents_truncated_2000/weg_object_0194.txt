This document describes the 9P148 Russian 4x4 Amphibious Anti-Tank Guided Missile Carrier.

The 9P148 is a Soviet anti-tank missile carrier. Unusually this anti-tank vehicle has got no proper name and is referred to by its military index designation. It is based on a BRDM-2 armored scout car chassis and is fitted with Konkurs (Western designation AT-5 Spandrel) anti-tank guided missiles. It was a successor to the 9P122 anti-tank missile carrier, which was also based on the BRDM-2 chassis, but packed older and less capable Malyutka (AT-3 Sagger) missiles. The 9P148 was first seen in 1977. This missile carrier was exported to a number of Soviet allies. Despite its age, the 9P148 is still used by the Russian military. It is also operational with some former Soviet republics and export operators, including Armenia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, and Slovakia.

The 9P148 vehicle has five Konkurs missiles in a ready-to-launch position on the roof and carries 10 reload missiles internally. When not in use the whole launcher with missiles is retracted inside the hull. The launcher is reloaded under complete armor protection.

The platform vehicle is a BRDM-2M/GAZ-41-08.

A variety of ATGM mixes have been seen with 9P148, between AT-4 (Spigot) and AT-5-type (Spandrel) ATGMs. The primary benefit of adaptability is increased launcher load and adaptability to user countries' inventories of ATGMs. The most common ATGM is AT-5. As AT-5B is produced, it is likely to replace AT-5 in better-budgeted country inventories.

Reload time for the launcher is 25 seconds.

Russian firms have developed countermeasures, such as encoded-pulse beacons for ATGMs and counter-dazzler adjustments to the 9S451M1 guidance box. Filters can be mounted in front of reticles.

The 1PN66 thermal sight is available for the ATGM launcher. The acquisition range is approximately 2,500 meters.

Russian KBP offers a drop-in one-man turret, called Kliver, with a stabilized 2A72 30-mm gun, a 4 Kornet ATGM launcher, thermal sights, and an improved fire control system.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Bulgaria, CFE Treaty, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia.

Here is Variants information for the 9P148 Russian 4x4 Amphibious Anti-Tank Guided Missile Carrier:
The BRDM-2 is basic reconnaissance vehicle, distinguished by its turret, which is the same as that mounted on the BTR-60PB. The conical turret, which mounts two machine guns (14.5 mm and 7.62 mm), is unusual in that it has no top hatch opening. This model carries a crew of four: the commander, the gunner, the driver, and the co-gunner. It also has a land navigation system that gives coordinate readings. The late Production version had mushroom-type vents on top of the engine compartment. The final production model had two additional turret periscopes, one on top of the turret and the other one on the left-hand side of the turret, and a TNA-2 navigation apparatus. It was also known under designations BTR-40PB, BTR-40P-2, and GAZ 41-08..
The BRDM-2RKh is BRDM-2RKh (khimicheskaya razvedivatel’naya mashina) – radiological-chemical reconnaissance vehicle with two KZO-2 rectangular dispensers for emplacing warning poles and flags around contaminated areas. The pole/flag dispensers are located on the rear corners of the vehicle's hull. The dispensers are normally covered with canvas and when required are positioned vertically over the rear of the vehicle. The specialized equipment consists of an automatic gas detector GSA-12, a dosimeter DP-5V, a röntgenmeter DP-3B, decontamination apparatus DK-4K and semi-automatic detection devices PPKhR and VPKhR. The vehicle retains the original armament. The regimental chemical defense platoon and the divisional-level chemical defense company use it, as the does divisional reconnaissance battalion. It was also known under designations BRDM-2RKhA, BTR-40P-2RKh, and BTR-40PB-RKh..
The BRDM-2RKhb is BRDM-2RKhb – an improved model that can also be used for biological reconnaissance, thanks to specialized equipment including the DP-5B röntgenmeter and biological aerosol detector ASP. BRDM-2RKhb doesn't have firing ports. This model has twin 7.62 mm PKT general-purpose machine guns instead of the 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial general-purpose machine gun and usually carries only one KZO-2 dispenser. It was also known under the designation BRDM-2RKhB..
The BRDM-2UM is BRDM-2UM (mashina upravleniya) – command vehicle without turret; however, it carries a 1 kW generator and extra radios (two R-123 and an R-107, or according to other sources one R-105M, one R-108M, and one R-130M). On either side of the upper hull, there is a big antenna base. Contrary to general Western belief, this is actually a very rare vehicle primarily built for export..
The 9P122 "Malyutka" is 9P122 "Malyutka" – ATGM launcher vehicle with 6x9M14M "Malyutka-M" (AT-3B Sagger B) on an elevatable mount with overhead cover. A total of 14 missiles are carried on board. This model is found in regimental and divisional anti-tank units of MRDs, the anti-tank regiments of combined arms armies (CAA), and in the anti-tank regiment or brigade in the artillery division of a front. It has a crew of 2..
The 9P133 "Malyutka" is 9P133 "Malyutka" – this is an improved model with a bigger sight 9S446 instead of the original 9S414. The 9P133 can launch the more capable 9M14P "Malyutka-P" (AT-3C Sagger C) and 9M14P1 missiles of which it carries from 16 to 18. It uses SACLOS guidance system. The vehicle also has an additional windscreen on the front between the driver's windscreen and the sight mounting..
The 9P124 is 9P124 – ATGM carrier vehicle with 4 radio-guided 9M17M "Skorpion-M" (AT-2B Swatter B) AT missiles on an elevatable mount with overhead cover. In the hull are four more missiles. It uses MCLOS guidance system. The 9P124 has a crew of 2. It was also known under the designation BRDM-3..
The 9P137 "Flejta" is 9P137 "Flejta" – improved model that uses the 9K8 "Flejta" system which allows usage of 9M19P ATGMs with SACLOS instead of MCLOS guidance. The launcher has 5 rails instead of 4..
The 9P148 "Konkurs" is 9P148 "Konkurs" – ATGM launcher vehicle with 5 wire-guided 9M113 "Konkurs" (AT-5 Spandrel). The AT-5 launcher can also fire the 9M111 "Fagot" (AT-4 Spigot) missile. The early production model of 9P148 could only fire 9M113 "Konkurs". The crew reloads the launcher through a small hatch located behind it. The gunner controls the missiles through a sight mounted on the front right of the vehicle. The 9P148 can carry a total of 10 9M111 and 10 9M113 or 14 9M113. From 1996 some Russian 9P148 were fitted with an improved 1PN66 day/night thermal sight. In the West, it was also known under the incorrect designation BRDM-3..
The 9P148 "Konkurs" is 9P148 "Konkurs" with the whip antenna mount fitted to the right-hand side pistol port. This is the standard production model..
The 9P31 is 9P31 – launcher vehicle for the 9M31 surface-to-air missile, belonging to the 9K31 Strela-1 (NATO: SA-9 "Gaskin") vehicle-mounted low-altitude SAM system. The SAM launching system with a quadruple canister replaces the machine gun turret on top of the vehicle, it is capable of 360 degrees traverse and limited elevation. It is lowered for travel. The vehicle doesn't have belly wheels. The vehicle carries 8 missiles. The crew went down to three (commander, driver, and gunner)..
The 9P31 is 9P31 with resupply racks on the upper sides of the hull..
The 9P31 is 9P31 fitted with the passive radar detection system 9S12 (FLAT BOX A) and three sensors mounted around the carrier vehicle (one next to the launcher, one on the center of the engine deck, and one between windscreens), giving it 360-degree coverage. This system emits no radar energy but can detect radio waves emitted from aircraft, giving the vehicle warning about incoming aircraft and aiding in the acquisition of the target aircraft with the optical system. Typical tactics call for the launch of two missiles against each target to improve the chance of destroying it..
The ZS-82 is ZS-82 (zvukoveshchatel'naya stantsiya) – PsyOps vehicle with a large box speaker array on top of an unarmed turret..
The TM-1 is TM-1 – BRDM-2 armored scout car converted into a fire and rescue vehicle. It has a visual warning device on top of the unarmed turret..
