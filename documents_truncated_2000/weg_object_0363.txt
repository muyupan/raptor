The QBZ-95 ('Type 95 Automatic Rifle') is a bullpup-style assault rifle designed and manufactured by Norinco for the People's Liberation Army, the armed forces of the People's Republic of China, People's Armed Police (para-military police), and other Chinese law enforcement agencies. This weapon uses the 5.8×42mm DBP87, an intermediate cartridge of Chinese origin. The QBZ-95 consists of a system of firearms using a common design. This family includes a carbine variant, a standard rifle, and a light support weapon.

The QBZ-95 was first observed outside China on 1 July 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. It is a modern weapon system in a bullpup configuration, where the weapon's action and magazine are located behind the grip and trigger assembly. The weapon was designed to replace the standard-issue Type 81 assault rifle.
