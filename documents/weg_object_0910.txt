This document describes the OH-6J Japanese Light Scout and Observation Helicopter.

The Kawasaki OH-6J is a licensed variant of the Hughes Helicopter OH-6 Cayuse American light observation helicopter for use by the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF). The JGSDF employed the helicopter in a reconnaissance and observation role as well as part of a hunter killer team with the AH-1S Cobra.
