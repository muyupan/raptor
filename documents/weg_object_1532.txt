This document describes the Mandau Class Indonesian Fast Attack Craft.

The Mandau-class is a class of four missile-armed fast attack craft operated by the Indonesian Navy. They were built by the Korea Tacoma shipyard from 1977 to 1980.

In 1975, Indonesia placed an order with the South Korean shipbuilder, Korea Tacoma International, for 4 PSK Mark 5 missile armed fast attack craft. The design was based on Korea Tacoma's PSSM patrol boat built for the Republic of Korea Navy, which in turn was based on the Asheville-class gunboat built for the US Navy.

The ships are 53.58 m (175 ft 9 in) long, with a beam of 8.00 m (26 ft 3 in) and a draught of 1.63 m (5 ft 4 in). Displacement is 250 long tons (250 t) standard and 290 long tons (290 t) full load. The ships's machinery is arranged in a 2-shaft, Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) layout, with a single General Electric-Fiat LM2500 gas turbine rated at 25,000 shp (19,000 kW) powering the ship at high speeds, with two MTU 12V331 TC81 diesel engines rated at 1,120 bhp (840 kW) each, power the ship at lower speeds. Maximum speed is 41 kn (47 mph; 76 km/h) using the gas turbine, and 17 kn (20 mph; 31 km/h) using the diesels. Range is 2,500 nmi (2,900 mi; 4,600 km) at 17 kn (20 mph; 31 km/h).

The ships are fitted with a single Bofors 57 mm SAK-57 Mk I gun forward, with a Bofors 40 mm L/70 gun aft, with two Rheinmetall 20 mm cannon providing close-in defence. Four mm 38 Exocet anti-ship missiles can be carried. The ships have a crew of 7 officers and 36 other ranks.

A Racal Decca 1226 I-band surface search radar is fitted, while fire control is by a Signaal WM 28 fire control radar and a Selenia NA-18 optronic director.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Indonesia.
