This document describes the Barrett XM500 American Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle.

The Barrett XM500 is a gas-operated, semi-automatic sniper rifle/anti-materiel rifle currently in development by the Barrett Firearms Company. It is fed by a 10-round detachable box magazine situated behind the trigger in a bullpup configuration.

Based on the design of the Barrett M82/M107 .50-caliber sniper rifle, it is intended to be a lighter, more compact alternative to the M82. Since the XM500 has a stationary barrel (instead of the recoiling-barrel design of the M82), it will likely have somewhat better accuracy. As with its predecessor, it comes with a removable, adjustable bipod mounted under the barrel, and a top-mounted Picatinny rail for the attachment of a scope or other accessory.

XM500 rifle is the most recent creation of the famous American Barrett Firearms co. This rifle, first shown in 2006, is intended to provide a lighter and more compact alternative to the popular Barrett M82 "Light fifty" rifle, which is widely used by military and law enforcement forces around the world. The new weapon will provide better accuracy (because of its stationary, non-recoiling barrel) and the same range as Light Fifty, while being lighter and significantly shorter, thanks to its bullpup layout. According to available information, this rifle is developed primarily for US Armed forces and is still in the development/prototype stage.

Barrett XM500 long-range sniper / anti-material rifle is a gas-operated, semiautomatic rifle. The gas chamber and piston are located above the barrel. Barrel is locked using a rotary bolt. Stock is of bullpup layout and made of metal, with rubber butt plate. A rifle is fitted with detachable lightweight bipods, adjustable for height. There are no open sights as of now, but the rifle is fitted with an integral Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver, so any type of sights can be installed using appropriate mounting interfaces.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.
