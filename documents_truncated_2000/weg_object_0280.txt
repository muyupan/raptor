This document describes the 9P157 Khrizantema-S Russian Anti-Tank Guided Missile System.

The 9P157 Khrizantema-S Russian Anti-Tank Guided Missile System was developed as a launch platform for the 9M123 Khrizantema missile. Although the 9P157 uses a BMP-3 chassis, newer missile, and dual guidance mode its mission and design philosophy is similar to the older 9P149 Shturm-S tank destroyer. The Khrizantema-S is mounted on a BMP-3 chassis, with the complete launch vehicle referred to by either the 9P157 (for the only vehicle in the 9K123 subfamily) or 9P157-2 and 9P157-3 (for vehicles in 9K123-1 Khrizantema-S subfamily) GRAU designations.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, CFE Treaty, Libya, Russian Federation.
