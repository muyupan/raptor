This document describes the Alkmaar Class Dutch Minehunter.

In the Royal Netherlands Navy, the Tripartites are known as the Alkmaar class. The Alkmaars were originally of similar design to the Belgian and French versions, with a standard displacement of 520 tonnes (510 long tons) and 553 tonnes (544 long tons) at full load. The displacement later increased to 571 tonnes (562 long tons) standard and 605 tonnes (595 long tons) at full load and then 630 tonnes (620 long tons) standard and 660 tonnes (650 long tons) at full load. The 20 mm gun that was initially mounted was removed, leaving only three 12.7 mm machine guns. Beginning in 2003, the remaining Dutch Alkmaar-class minehunters were upgraded with improved electronics, including Atlas Elektronik INCMS combat data system, Thales 2022 Mk III hull-mounted sonar, Atlas Seafox Mine Identification and Disposal System and a Double Eagle Mk III Mod 1 ROV.

The minehunters were constructed at the Van der Giessen-de-Noord yard in Amsterdam, a specially constructed site completed in 1978. Middelburg and Hellevoetsluis were optioned by Egypt, but due to financial issues, were instead completed for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Two ships of a modified design were built for the Indonesian Navy which led to the delay of Vlaardingen and Willemstad's construction.

Ships in class (Netherlands)
In 2000, three ships (Alkmaar, Delfzijl and Dordrecht) were withdrawn from service, followed by two more (Harlingen and Scheveningen) in 2003. All five were sold to Latvia with handovers beginning in 2007. Four more ships, (Haarlem, Maasluis, Middelburg and Hellevoetsluis) were decommissioned in 2011 following a series of deep budget cuts to the navy.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Netherlands.
