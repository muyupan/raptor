This document describes the 2S6M Tunguska-M Russian 30mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System.

The 2S6M Tunguska-M (SA-19) Russian 30mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System is a gun/missile system for low-level air defense. The system was designed by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau in Tula, Russia, and is manufactured by the Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant, Ulyanovsk, Russia. It can engage targets while stationary and on the move, using missiles for long-range targets and guns for close-in defense. It is designed for defense against both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters and can also fire on ground targets.

Tunguska entered service with the Russian army in 1988 and has been exported to Germany, India, Peru, Morocco, and Ukraine.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, India, Morocco, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Yemen.

Here is Radar #1 information for the 2S6M Tunguska-M Russian 30mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System of the Radar System:
The Name is 1 x 1RL144 Radar.
The Type is Target Acquisition Radar (TAR).
The Function is This radar provides primary search capability in addition to measurement of range and bearing.
The Frequency/Band is E-band.
The Maximum Range is 20.
The Antenna Location is The antenna is mounted at the rear of the turret and is folded down when not in use..
The Antenna Rotation is The antenna rotates at approximately 1 r/s, which gives a rapid update of the airspace around the 2S6M..
The Fan Beam is The TAR emits a fan beam covering 4.50 in azimuth and 150 in elevation. The beam is pointed at a constant elevation of 7.50 to permit detection of low-altitude targets..

Here is Radar #2 information for the 2S6M Tunguska-M Russian 30mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System of the Radar System:
The Name is 1 x 1RL144M.
The Type is Target Tracking Radar (TTR).
The Function is The tracking radar constantly relays target range, elevation and bearing to the fire-control computer, and on the basis if these data the computer generated the laying commands for the weapon system..
The Frequency/Band is J-band.
The Maximum Range is 18.
The Antenna Location is The antenna is mounted at the front section of the turret and has two fundamental functions that depend on whether the guns or missiles are selected..
The Optical Sight is A stabilized optical sight is used as a back up tracking channel, allowing target data to be relayed to the fire-control computer. This sight is also used to calculate the deviation of a missile's flight path from the line-of-sight, these data being automatically relayed to the fire control computer and used to generate correction signals..
The Gun Engagement is During a gun engagement, the TTR functions as an automatic target tracker, feeding target position data to the fire-control computer..
The Missile Engagement is During missile engagement, the tracking radar locks onto the target and then lays the optical sight on the target. Subsequently the gunner assumes the target-tracking function with the electro-optic sight, and the radar is used for relaying guidance commands to the SA-19 missile..
