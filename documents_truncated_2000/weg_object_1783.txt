This document describes the GAZ-66 Russian 4x4 Light Utility Truck.

The GAZ-66 is a Soviet and later Russian 4x4 all-road (off-road) military truck produced by GAZ. It was one of the main cargo vehicles for motorized infantry of the Soviet Army and is still employed in former Soviet Union countries. It is nicknamed shishiga (шишига) shehsherik (шешерик) trueman (in Siberia).

Almost one million vehicles of this type were built for both military and civil use. The GAZ-66 has gained legendary status in many countries around the world due to its reliability, simplicity, and off-road capability. Thanks to standard features, such as a front-mounted winch, Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS), and self-locking differentials, the GAZ-66 is extremely popular worldwide with armed forces and off-road enthusiasts. Production ceased in 1999, with the GAZ-3308 being produced instead.

Besides functioning as a general cargo carrier, the GAZ-66 is used as a prime mover for 120mm mortars.  The DDA-66 variant is an NBC decontamination truck.
