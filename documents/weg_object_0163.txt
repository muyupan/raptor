This document describes the P-15 (Flat Face A) Russian Mobile 2D UHF Radar.

The P-15 is a high mobility radar. With the antenna mounted directly on the single truck (Zil-157) used for transport, the system could be deployed and taken down in no more than 10 minutes. The P-15 uses two open frame elliptical parabolic antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, each antenna being fed by a single antenna feed. The radar can rapidly shift its frequency to one of four preset frequencies to avoid active interference, with passive interference being removed by a coherent doppler filter. Azimuth was determined by mechanical scanning with an associated accompanying PRV-11 (NATO reporting name "Side Net") used to determine elevation. A secondary radar for IFF is generally used in conjunction with the P-15, generally the 1L22 "Parol".

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Czech Republic, Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the P-15 (Flat Face A) Russian Mobile 2D UHF Radar:
The Flat Face B (Russian P-19) is This radar was developed from the Flat Face A. It is associated with SA-2 Guideline, SA-3 Goa, SA-6 Gainful, and SA-8 Gecko SAM systems. It is also designated the 1RL134. The P-19 is truck-mounted on a 6 x 6 chassis and employs an antenna array with two elliptical reflectors mounted one above the other. Like the P-15, it uses the 1L22 Parol IFF equipment. Digital plot processing has been fitted..
