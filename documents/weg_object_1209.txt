This document describes the NTC VISMOD RPG-7 Russian Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher.

The RPG-7 is designed to carried and operated by one user, ammunition is also carried by the user but can be distributed amongst the section. For firing, an expelling charge is screwed to the rocket motor base and the grenade is inserted rearwards into the launcher muzzle where a small crossâcut screw head is mated with an index notch in the muzzle. This lines up the ignition cap with the percussion hammer. The safety pin and the fuse cover on the warhead are then removed. The hammer at the upper rear of the pistol grip is thumbâcocked and, when the trigger is depressed, the hammer rises to strike the primer and fire the grenade.
