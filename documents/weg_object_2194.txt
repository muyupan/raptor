The MIACAH F1 (L14A1 in British service) is a French off-route anti-tank landmine. It uses a large Misznay Schardin effect warhead to project a powerful self forging fragment capable of penetrating 70 millimetres of armour at a range of 40 metres.

The mine consists of a horizontal cylindrical main body with a large inset plate in the front. The detonator protrudes from the centre of the front plate. The main body is supported on two arms which are attached to a circular base with three stakes. The mine can be triggered by a 50-metre breakwire, command or electronically triggered by an external sensor.
