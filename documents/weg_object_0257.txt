This document describes the 3M54K (SS-N-27 Sizzler) Russian Medium-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile.

The 3M54K (SS-N-27 Sizzler) Russian Medium-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile variant is deployed by the Russian Navy. Its length is 8.22 m (27.0 ft), with a 200 kg (440 lb) warhead. Its range is 440–660 km (270–410 mi). It is a Sea-skimmer with a final stage flight altitude of 4.6 meters (15 ft) and a supersonic terminal speed of Mach 2.9 (3,550 km/h; 2,210 mph).

The 3M-54 Kalibr, (Калибр, caliber), also referred to it as 3M54-1 Kalibr, 3M14 Biryuza (Бирюза, turquoise), (NATO codenames SS-N-27 Sizzler and SS-N-30A), 91R1, 91RT2 is a group of Russian surface ship-, submarine-launched and airborne anti-ship and coastal anti-ship (AShM), land-attack cruise missiles (LACM) and anti-submarine missiles developed by the Novator Design Bureau (OKB-8). Derived export versions are the 3M54E, 3M54E1, 3M14E, 91RE1, 91RTE2. The 3M54T, 3M54K, 3M54A, 3M54E (3M54TE), 3M54KE, and 3M54AE have a second stage that performs a supersonic sprint in the terminal approach to the target, reducing the time that the target's defense systems have to react. The 3M54T1, 3M54K1, 3M54A1, 3M54E1 (3M54T/K/AE1) only travel at subsonic speeds, although its range is accordingly greater than those of the supersonic versions.

The club is the designation used for the export versions.

The missile is a modular system with five versions: two anti-shipping types, one for land attack and two anti-submarine types. The missile is designed to share common parts between the surface and submarine-launched variants but each missile consists of different components, for example, the booster. The missile can be launched from a surface ship using a Vertical Launch System (VLS). It has a booster with thrust vectoring capability. The missile launched from a submarine torpedo tube has no need for such an addition but has a conventional booster instead. The air-launched version is held in a container that is dropped as the missile launches, detaching from the container.

Kalibr land-attack versions in use by Russia have various claimed maximum ranges. The U.S. Department of Defense estimates its range at 1,400 km (870 mi), and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu put its range at "almost 1,500 km (930 mi)." Following its first operational firing in October 2015, Russian Ministry of Defense statements suggested a range of 2,000 km (1,200 mi), while a December 2015 Office of Naval Intelligence report gathered a number of Russian statements projecting ranges between 1,500-2,500 km (1,600 mi). Discrepancies in range values may be attributed to political declarations for strategic effect, or potentially longer 2,500 km-range claims could be associated with a thermonuclear armed variant while shorter 1,500 km-range estimates are for the conventionally armed missile.

The Russian domestic variant (3M54T / 3M54K) and export variants (3M54TE/3M54KE) fly at sub-sonic speeds while achieving supersonic speed as they near their target. They are also capable of performing very high angled defensive high-speed maneuvers in contrast to the common linear flight path of other anti-ship cruise missiles.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, China, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Russian Federation, Viet Nam.

The 3M14K (SS-N-30A) is 3M14K (SS-N-30A) An inertial guidance land attack variant deployed by the Russian Navy. The submarine-launched weapon has a basic length of 6.2 m (20 ft), with a 450 kg (990 lb) warhead. Its range is 2,500 km (1,600 mi), allowing the Russian Navy to strike targets throughout central Western Europe (including all of the UK, northern France including Paris, and most of Germany) from beyond the GIUK gap. Its subsonic terminal speed is Mach 0.8..
