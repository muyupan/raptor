This document describes the S-300PMU-1 (SA-20 Gargoyle) Russian Long-Range Air Defense Missile System.

The SA-20 Gargoyle (S-300PMU-1) Russian Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System was first introduced in 1993 with the new and larger 48N6 missiles for the first time in a land-based system and introduced all the same performance improvements from the S300FM version including the increased speed, range, TVM guidance, and ABM capability. The warhead is slightly smaller than the naval version at 143 kg (315 lb). This version also saw the introduction of the new and more capable 30N6E TOMB STONE radar. The S-300PMU1 air defense missile system can simultaneously engage up to 36 air targets with 72 missiles.

The S-300PMU-1 was introduced in 1993 and for the first time introduces several different kinds of missiles in a single system. In addition to the 5V55R and 48N6E missiles, the S-300PMU-1 can utilize two new missiles, the 9M96E1 and 9M96E2. Both are significantly smaller than the previous missiles at 330 and 420 kg (730 and 930 lb) respectively and carry a smaller 24 kg (53 lb) warhead. The 9M96E1 has an engagement range of 1–40 km (0.62–25 mi) and the 9M96E2 of 1–120 km (0.62–75 mi). They are still carried 4 per TEL. Rather than just relying on aerodynamic fins for maneuvering, they use a gas-dynamic system which allows them to have an excellent probability of kill (Pk) despite the much smaller warhead. The Pk is estimated at 0.7 against a tactical ballistic missile for either missile. The S-300PMU-1 typically uses the 83M6E command and control system, although it is also compatible with the older Baikal-1E and Senezh-M1E CCS command and control systems. The 83M6E system incorporates the 64N6E (BIG BIRD) surveillance/detection radar. The fire control/illumination and guidance radar used is the 30N6E, optionally matched with a 76N6 low altitude detection radar and a 96L6E all altitude detection radar. The 83M6E command and control system can control up to 12 TELs, both the self-propelled 5P85SE vehicle and the 5P85TE towed launchers. Generally, support vehicles are also included, such as the 40V6M tow vehicle, intended for the lifting of the antenna post

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Greece, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Russian Federation, Viet Nam.
