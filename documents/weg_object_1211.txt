This document describes the JRTC VISMOD: BMD-3 Russian Airborne Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The BMD-3 (Boyevaya Mashina Desanta, Russian "ÐÐ¾ÐµÐ²Ð°Ñ ÐÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð° ÐÐµÑÐ°Ð½ÑÐ°", literally "Combat Vehicle of the Airborne") is an infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) originating from the former Soviet Union. This armored fighting vehicle is one of the lightest in its class and is intended to be a fire support platform for use by airborne and air assault units. The primary armament is a 30 mm 2A42 autocannon capable of firing different types of ammunition which include high-explosive and armor-piecing. The BMD-3 possesses multiple secondary weapons such as the 9M113 Konkurs missile and the AGS-17 grenade launcher to defeat a wide range of targets from enemy infantry to other armored fighting vehicles.

The development of this 3rd generation airborne combat vehicle was initiated during the same time frame of the development of the BMP-3. However, the results of the development showed that the mass of the BMP-3 with landing facilities will significantly exceed 20 tonnes limiting an Il-76 to transporting one vehicle. In the early 1980s, the creation of an airborne combat vehicle was initiated. During the design, two options were considered for the BMD-3. The first one included a chassis weighing over 18 tonnes with a 100 mm 2A70 rifled gun and a coaxial 30 mm 2A72 autocannon. The second option was to use the combat module with a 30 mm 2A42 autocannon. Thus, an IL-76 could be loaded either with two airborne combat vehicles weighing 18 tonnes, or three airborne combat vehicles weighing 12.5 tonnes. Research showed that the latter version of the new BMD-3 ran much more efficiently. On the basis of the experience gained and the results of the research, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the CPSU number 451-159 officially opened the ROC under the code "Bakhcha" on 20 May 1983. Work included the development of an airborne combat vehicle weighing 12.5 tonnes with the Volgograd tractor factory appointed as the head developer.

One month later, an agreement was made for the tactical and technical requirements for the new BMD as well as a complete technical design stage. When developing the new BMD, the experience gained in the course of work on the BMD-1 and "Object 934" light tank was used. By 1985, the acceptance testing of three new BMD prototypes was completed. The test results revealed that all the samples exceeded the permissible mass by 190â290 kg and that the running vehicle gave numerous failures. The design bureau VgTZ fixed most of the shortcomings and were eliminated. By May 1986, the refined BMD prototypes completed preliminary tests with three more prototypes developed by the Volgograd tractor factory. These were sent to the state test for another evaluation. New samples exceeded the permissible mass by 400 kg, as they were made subject to measures of improving the reliability of the running transmission gears. The BMD state tests took place between 27 October 1986 and 27 October 1987. According to test results, two to three vehicles were completed and sent to the control tests in different climatic zones conducted from 10 July to 19 November 1988. The conclusion for the "Bakhcha" was assessed as positive with the vehicle fulfilling the tactical and technical requirements set by the airborne troops. On 10 February 1990, the USSR adopted the "Object 950" IFV into service under the designation BMD-3. The serial production of the BMD-3 was then initiated and continued until 1997. Excluding six prototypes produced before 1990, 137 BMD-3s were produced from the year of its adoption to the end of its serial production.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Angola, China, Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the JRTC VISMOD: BMD-3 Russian Airborne Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV):
The BMD-3K is The commander variant of the BMD-3 adopted by the Russian Army in 1996. Mass production of this vehicle was never initiated..
The 2S25 Sprut-SD (Object 952) is A self-propelled anti-tank gun that entered service in 2005. This vehicle has the chassis of the BMD-3 and is operated by a crew of three. The main armament is the 125 mm 2A75 smoothbore gun which is a variant of the 2A46 smoothbore gun series used by Soviet main battle tanks since the T-64. It can fire the ammunition of the 2A46 including the 9M119 Svir. The chassis has seven road wheels on each side instead of five and the engine is now the 2V-06-2S with a power of 510 hp..
The BTR-MD âRakushkaâ (Object 955) is A multi-role transport vehicle with bigger hull and no turret. This type can be used to transport troops, fuel, ammunition and wounded personnel. It also serves as the basis for a new range of specialised vehicles for the Russian airborne forces, including a mortar platform and an ambulance..
The BTR-MDM is A modernized version with the same improvements as the BMD-4M..
The RKhM-5 (Object 958) is A chemical reconnaissance vehicle introduced in 2011 and is fitted with the same specialized equipment as the BTR-80 version known as the RKhM-4. The turret has been removed; the RKhM-5 has a fixed superstructure with a machine gun turret. The hull is larger allowing it to transport troops, fuel, ammunition and wounded personnel.
The BMD-4 (Object 960) is Originally designated as the BMD-3M, this vehicle has a modified chassis with new turret known as the "Bakhcha-U". The weaponry bears greater similarity to the BMP-3. This new armament consists of: a 100 mm 2A70 rifled main gun, a 30mm 2A72 autocannon, a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun, and new "Ramka" fire control system. The bow-mounted AGS-17 has been removed and is replaced with an AGS-30. BMD-4s are newly built or upgraded BMD-3s. The BMD-4 is no longer being purchased for the Russian troops, in favor of the BMD-4M..
The BMD-4M is The upgraded variant with a new chassis and the 500 hp UTD-29 engine of the BMP-3. This version will be produced by Kurganmashzavod (KTZ) instead of VgTZ. The vehicle was presented to the VDV in March 2008. According to KTZ, series production could have started in 2009. The BMD-4M was evaluated by the VDV.
The BMM-D is A command post vehicle and a recovery vehicle. Some variants will have a longer chassis with seven road wheels and probably the same 510 hp engine as the 2S25..
