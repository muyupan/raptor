This document describes the ScanEagle American Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

ScanEagle provides persistent daytime and nighttime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) in some of the most extreme environments in the world. Digital full motion video (FMV) provides the highest
available ground resolution. As the industry-leading UAS that invented the agile ISR category, ScanEagle has redefined ISR services for Group 2, long-endurance UAS. ScanEagle provides superior operational
capability and reliability, with advanced payload options and rapid payload integration.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Tunisia, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Viet Nam, Yemen.
