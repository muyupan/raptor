This document describes the WM-80 Chinese 273mm Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL).

The WM-80 multiple launch rocket system was developed by China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO) based on the indigenous Type 83 273mm 4-tube artillery rocket system. The WM-80 did not enter PLA service, possibly due to the introduction of the more capable A-100 artillery rocket system. NORINCO has been promoting the weapon system to the export market and made one sale to Armenia in 1999. The WM-80 rocket system is composed of multiple rocket launchers, ammunition transporter/loader, fire command and control vehicles, and maintenance vehicles. The fire command and control is composed of a brigade/regiment command vehicle, battalion command vehicle, surveillance/spotting radar, and meteorological radar.
A total of six launcher vehicles and six resupply vehicles would be attached to each battery. The standard combat unit is considered to be the battalion with the customer choosing his own Table Of Equipment (TOE) if they so wish.  Fire-control and command duties throughout the brigade are accomplished by the use of an automatic distribution network. This consists of main computers located at the brigade, battalion, and battery HQ command levels with various terminals and radio/wire communications links to automatically distribute the data as directed.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, China, Jordan.
