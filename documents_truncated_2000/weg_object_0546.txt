This document describes the G-5 South African 155mm Towed Howitzer.

The APU, combined with the tandem walking beam suspension, gives the G5 excellent self-propelled mobility over short distances. The four wheels are all powered and give the gun excellent traction over most terrain. But, the APU serves purposes other than mobility. It provides power to open and close the trails, raise and lower the trail wheels, and raise and lower the firing platform. However, there is no power traverse or elevation. Although designed for an eight-man section, the South African defense force normally operates the G5 with a five-man section. However, the G5 can operate with a minimum of two people when all of the powered systems are working. The G-5 MKIII includes 35 reliability modifications and performance improvements. The improvements include the addition of the AS2000 gun monitor, an improved braking system, bigger diameter and wider trail wheels (specifically designed for sand), and incorporation of the Reutech ACV 58 communication system.
The cannon is ballistically matched to the 2S3M self-propelled howitzer thus, it can generally fire the same ammunition to the same range.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Chile, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Malaysia, Qatar, South Africa.
