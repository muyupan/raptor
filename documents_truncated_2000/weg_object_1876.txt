HEZBOLLAH Proliferation. The 9K111 Fagot (AT-4 Spigot) Russian Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) is a late Cold War-era anti-tank missile of Soviet origin. The 9K111 is better known in the West by its NATO designation "AT-4 Spigot". It was developed in the late 1960s as a more compact and more effective system than the 9K11 Malyutka system. The 9K111 is a medium-range system and is in the same league as the French Milan system. The 9K111 Fagot system is a man-portable system that uses a reusable manpack launcher. The 9M111 missile is transported in and launched from a container. The missile has a booster charge and a sustainer rocket motor. Four small vanes at the front and four large wings in the middle provide stability during launch. The 9M111 is wire-guided and features SACLOS guidance. The 9P135 lightweight tripod launcher includes an optical sight system and computing mechanism. The same launcher can be used with the larger and longer-range 9M113 Konkurs missile.
