This document describes the CAR 817 Emirati 7.62mm Assault Rifle.

The Caracal Assault Rifle 817, or CAR 817 was developed in the United Arab Emirates by a Caracal International company. This weapon is intended for elite military and law enforcement units.

   It is a gas operated, selective fire weapon. The CAR 817 is a version of the CAR 816, but chambered for a more powerful 7.62x51 mm ammunition. The CAR 817 is heavier, but is more accurate and has a longer range. The CAR 817 is similar in concept to the German Heckler & Koch HK417 battle rifle. Internally it resembles Stoner-designed weapons, such as the M16, but all working parts were enlarged to suit the larger 7.62x51 mm ammunition.

   The CAR 817 is available with 3 barrel lengths. There is an automatic rifle with a 406 mm (16") barrel, carbine with a 386 mm (14.5") barrel, and compact assault rifle with a 317 mm (12.5") barrel. Special forces, often prefer more compact rifles, that are chambered for powerful 7.62x51 mm ammunition with greater penetrative power.

   The CAR 817 has an adjustable gas valve, which controls the gas system. There are three positions of the gas valve. First position is for normal operation. Second position is for operation when the system is fouled, for adverse conditions or when low impulse ammunition is used. The third position is used when the weapon is equipped with a sound suppressor.

   A fire mode selector is located above the pistol grip and is conveniently operated by the shooter's thumb. It has three positions for "safe", "semi-auto" and "full-auto". There is a semi-automatic only version of this weapon, intended for law enforcement forces.

   This weapon is fed from 10-, 20- or 25-round magazines.

   The CAR 817 has a telescopic buttstock, which can be adjusted for length. It has 6 positions. A similar buttstock is used on the Barrett REC7.

   This battle rifle has a full-length Picatinny-type scope rail. It comes as standard with detachable flip-up iron sights. However this weapon is mainly intended to be used with various optics. Range of effective fire is around 600 meters.

   The CAR 817 has greater range and accuracy than the CAR 816 assault rifle, though at a cost of increased weight, lower rate of fire and lower ammunition capacity (both in magazine and carriage). Due to its long range the CAR 817 can be even used for designated marksman role.

   There are additional accessory rails over the foregrip for various add-on equipment, such as laser pointers, tactical flashlights, vertical grips, bipods and so on. The CAR 816 can mount a sound suppressor and 40 mm underbarrel grenade launcher.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United Arab Emirates.
