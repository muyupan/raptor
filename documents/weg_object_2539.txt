This document describes the AMX-10 PAC 90 French Tank Destroyer / SP Artillery Piece.

Known as a "Tank Destroyer," The AMX-10 PAC 90 is dedicated fire support and an anti-tank variant of the AMX-10P infantry fighting vehicle. Its production commenced in 1979. This vehicle is in service with France, Brazil, and possibly some other countries. This fire support vehicle was designed to operate alongside the main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. At the time of its introduction, it was capable of taking anti-tank combat, however by current standards, its armament is too weak to knock out a modern MBT. It was also intended as a reconnaissance and infantry support vehicle.  The aluminum armor of this fire support vehicle provides all-around protection against small arms fire and artillery shell splinters. Front armor withstands 14.5 mm heavy machine gun rounds. The vehicle has an NBC protection system.
