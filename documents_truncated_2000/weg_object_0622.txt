This document describes the 2A45 (Sprut-A) Russian 125mm Towed Anti-Tank Gun.

The 2A45 is a towed, split-rail 125mm anti-tank gun. They are usually deployed on the flanks of a defensive position. They are very hard to spot until they shoot, and are effective at ranges of up to 2000m. The 2A45M shares similar ordnance to that of the T-72/T-80 MBTs. This ammunition is of the separate-loading type, but a dedicated round for the 2A45M may have been developed. The 2A45M is believed to be capable of firing the AT-11 SNIPER (Svir) laser beam riding, antitank guided missile which has a maximum range of 4000 meters.
