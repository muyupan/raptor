This document describes the YJ-8/C-802 (CSS-N-4 Sardine) Chinese Anti-Ship Missile.

YJ-8/C-802 (CSS-N-4 Sardine) Chinese Anti-Ship Missile is a Chinese surface-launched subsonic anti-ship cruise missile. It is manufactured by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) Third Academy.

The YJ-8 was developed into air-launched (YJ-81) and submarine-launched (YJ-82) variants.

The YJ-8 is either based on or is a heavily modified copy of, the MM38 Exocet; the two missiles share virtually identical operational profiles. The replication of the MM38's "revolutionary flight profile" in less than ten years and with an immature industrial base strongly suggests that China had access to proven technology.[4]

The YJ-8 was a "radical departure" from China's first anti-ship missiles derived from the P-15 Termit. The YJ-8 carried a smaller warhead but had the same range and speed while being significantly smaller and lighter.

The development of the YJ-8 was approved in late-1976 following a few years of encouraging work on solid-fuel rockets. According to a 1991 Aerospace China article, the development of the missile's engine began in 1978, and flight testing was completed in 1985. The YJ-8 reach initial operating capability in the People's Liberation Army Navy in 1987, the same year the export version—the C-801—was announced.

CASIC received the first National Science and Technology Advancement Award for the development of the YJ-8 in 1988.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Thailand, Yemen.
