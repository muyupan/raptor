This document describes the Natya-Class (Project 266M Akvamarin Class) Russian Ocean Minesweeper.

The Natya-class were a group of minesweepers built for the Soviet Navy and export customers during the 1970s and 1980s (58 ships were built). The Soviet designation was Project 266M Akvamarin. The ships were used for ocean minesweeping.

The design evolved from the Yurka class minesweeper with new demining equipment including more advanced sonar and closed-circuit TV. A stern ramp made recovering sweeps easier. The hull was built of low magnetic steel. To protect against acoustic mines the foundation's main engines and diesel generators were padded with rubber, installation of mechanisms for isolating dampers; installation of flexible inserts in pipes; application of low-noise propellers controlled step large-diameter, as well as the installation of low-noise machinery and equipment. An electrical field compensator was also installed.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: India, Libya, Russian Federation, Syria, Yemen.
