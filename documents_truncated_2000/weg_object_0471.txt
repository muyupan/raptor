This document describes the PZH-89 (Type 89) Chinese 122mm Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL).

The PZH-89 (Type 89) Chinese 122mm Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL) is a well-armored tracked vehicle that carries a 40-tube array. The vehicle chassis is based on a Type 83 152mm self-propelled gun/howitzer.  It appears very similar to the Soviet-designed BM-21 system.

The MRL chassis is a low, tank-like hull with six unevenly spaced road wheels. The engine is located under the right side of the shallow glacis with the vehicle's driver under the left side. The rest of the crew is housed in an armored compartment at the rear, under the launcher. The crew compartment has two large vision blocks on each side and a rear door.

On top of the hull, in place of Type 83's large gun turret, the MRL has an elevating, traversable mount with four rows of 10 tubes. Salvo fire of all 40 rockets takes less than 20 seconds; the rockets can also be fired singly. Ahead of the launcher is a large automatic-reload magazine with an additional 40 rockets.

The type was classified in 1989, although the 122mm, 40-round, rocket launcher is almost identical to the Russian 122mm BM-21 introduced in the 1960s.
It is no longer marketed or produced. The MRL remains in service. Approximately 250 systems were produced, according to MilitaryFactory.com (Feb. 28, 2016).

Late-model Type 89s have been modified to include a cover for the 40-round rocket pack. Additionally, the left rear side layer of the launcher has a fully enclosed and armored compartment.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Peru.
