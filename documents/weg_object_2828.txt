This document describes the Panther V (BCC 67/VRQ 327) British Portable VHF Frequency Hopping Secure EPM Radio.

The Panther V manpack transceiver provides 5 and 20 watts of RF power with un-matched co-site capability enabling operation in multiradio locations where the majority of similar manpack radios would fail. The transceiverâ€™s superior co-site performance also enables the manpack to be operated in a vehicle clip-in
configuration, with co-located 50 watt VHF radios, delivering up to 20 watts through the vehicle antenna.
