This document describes the Heidar-5 Russian 8x8 Armored Minelayer Vehicle.

During the Iranian Army Day, the local defense industry has presented the Heidar-5, a new minelayer wheeled vehicle able to launch anti-tank mines to create a mine barrier based on Soviet-made BTR-60 8x8 APC (Armored Personnel Carrier). The vehicle is equipped with an automatic firing unit located inside the vehicle.

The Heidar-5 minelayer is based on a modified Soviet-made BTR-60PB 8x8 armored personnel carrier. The original turret is removed and the troop's compartment is used to put a mine launching assembly mounted at the rear vehicle, with 18 mine launcher units mounted on each side of the hull.

According to our first analysis, each mine launcher unit has two preloaded magazines, each of which holds two anti-tank or anti-personnel mines. The vehicle seems to be equipped with an automatic firing system that can be used to preselect the resultant mine barrier data and can be placed into several laying modes that can be changed while the vehicle is moving.

The Heidar-5 could also create a mine barrier on the move. Mines are ejected on each side of the vehicle. In road position, the mine-laying system is covered by armor plates.

The front of the Heidar-5 is fitted with a remotely-operated weapon station armed with a Soviet-made DShK 12.7mm heavy machine gun.

The hull of the BTR-60PB is of all-welded steel armor with the driver and commander seated at the front of the hull. Both have a windscreen in front of them which, when in action, is covered by a flap hinged at the top.

The BTR-60PB enters into service with the Russian army in 1966. The vehicle is an eight-wheel-drive vehicle motorized with a 2 GAZ-49B 6-cylinder in-line water-cooled petrol engines developing 90 hp at 3,400 rpm each coupled to a manual transmission with 4 forward and 1 reverse gear. It can run at a maximum road speed of 80 km/h with a maximum cruising range of 500 km.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
