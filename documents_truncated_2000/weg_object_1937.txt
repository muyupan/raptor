This document describes the RPG-7D3 Russia Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher.

RPG-7D3: improved paratrooper model. It is equivalent to the RPG-7V2. It was adopted in 2001 and is a current production model, used the Russian armed forces and possibly some other countries.


The RPG-7 has seen such wide and varied service that it is nearly impossible to list all of the conflicts it has fought in. From the Vietnam War to the Gulf War, the RPG-7 is most certainly combat proven.

   The RPG-7 continues to be produced in countries such as Iraq, Romania, China, and Bulgaria. Even though it will continue to serve in low-budget forces for years in a fire-support role, it is being phased out by most militaries from the anti-armor role due to its limited effectiveness against modern main battle tanks.

   Perhaps the primary reason RPG-7s are so popular is the low cost—anywhere from $500-2 000 for a launcher and $100-500 per rocket.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
