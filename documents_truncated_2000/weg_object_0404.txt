This document describes the Hwasong-14 (KN-14) North Korean Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile.

Compared to KN-08, the KN-14, is a slightly shorter, with a blunt and rounded nose cone. Due to the lack of evidence to analyze, it is unclear if the KN-14 is a three- or two-staged missile, but some analysts suggest the latter to be more likely.

According to analysis by 38 North, the KN-14’s robust design has the potential of a 50-60% reliability, whereas it is estimated that the KN-08 would operate only 30-40% of the time.

Similar to the KN-08, the design of KN-14 appears comes from the Soviet-era R-27/SS-N-6 missiles. This seemed to be confirmed during the liquid-fueled engine test on April 9, 2016. While there is no video footage, images released of the test appear to show a pair of clustered 4D10 engines, which are used on the R-27.3 The images display the engines, embedded within a fuel tank fitted for an ICBM, spitting out bright orange exhaust, which is indicative of a highly efficient fuel called unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH). The use of such fuel could increase KN-14’s range.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).

Here is Variants information for the Hwasong-14 (KN-14) North Korean Intercontinental-Range Ballistic Missile:
The KN-08 is The KN-08 (North Korean: Hwasong-13; it has also been called the No Dong-C) is a three-stage, road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) being developed by North Korea. The missile is believed to be powered by 4D10 engines adapted from those on the Soviet R-27 (NATO: SS-N-6) missiles. Pyongyang reportedly obtained some of these missiles in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union..
