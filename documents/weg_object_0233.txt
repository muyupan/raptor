This document describes the YJ-12 Chinese Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile.

The YJ-12 Chinese Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile is a Chinese supersonic anti-ship cruise missile.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the YJ-12 Chinese Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile:
The YJ-12 is INA.
The YJ-12A is Naval surface-based variant, launched by rocket booster.
The YJ-12B is Land-based variant with 160 nmi (180 mi; 300 km) range.
The CM-400AKG is The CM-400AKG is an air-launched supersonic surface attack cruise missile, believed to be the export version of the YJ-12. The 910 kg (2,000 lb) missile is 0.4 m (1.3 ft) in diameter and has a range of between 54–130 nmi (62–150 mi; 100–241 km) while carrying either a 150 kg (330 lb) blast or 200 kg (440 lb) penetration warhead. It has three guidance options, including inertial navigation system (INS) coupled with satellite positioning to get within 50 m, an onboard IR/TV seeker for terminal guidance and 5 m accuracy, and passive radar to supplement the seeker, which delivers (strangely worse) 5–10 m accuracy. One unusual characteristic is that it does not fly at low altitude to avoid detection, but rather uses “high altitude launching” to achieve “higher aircraft survivability.” It may have a top speed of Mach 5..
The CM-302 is In November 2016, CASIC unveiled the CM-302 as the export version of the YJ-12. It is marketed as "the world's best anti-ship missile" that it is supersonic throughout its flight, can be launched from air, land, and naval platforms, can disable a 5,000-tonne warship, and be used in a land attack role. Assuming physical characteristics similar to the YJ-12, the missile is likely 7 m (23 ft) long and 0.6 m (2.0 ft) diameter, with an estimated weight of 2,000–2,500 kg (4,400–5,500 lb). It is stated to have a range of 280 km (170 mi; 150 nmi), a 250 kg (550 lb) warhead, guided by BeiDou which can be updated by data-link with an active radar seeker for terminal homing to achieve a 90% probability of hitting its target, while traveling at a mid-course speed of Mach 1.5-2 and accelerating to Mach 3 or higher during the terminal flight phase..
