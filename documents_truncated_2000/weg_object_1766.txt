Sungri-58 (승리 58호 - 'Victory 58') - A clone of the Soviet GAZ-51 (ГАЗ-51) Truck, however with weaker springs. The Sungri-58 also suffers from unusually high fuel consumption due to its crudely copied GAZ-51 carburetor which has been used since 1961. It was first built in 1958. Later Sungri-58KA and Sungri-58NA (4x4) modifications with new cabin are appeared in the 1970s.

Made from 1958- 1979. Based on Russian GAZ 51. Name Sungri (Synri, Sungli, Sungni) translated as Victory. Made by the Sungri General Auto Works, Tokchon. 4x2 truck, 2 ton payload, 3.5-litre 6-cylinder petrol engine. Exists as cargo truck, bus conversion, fire truck, and truck tractor. Often seen powered by gas generator (wood convertor). Most important North Korean truck for years.

The GAZ-51 (nickname Gazon) was a Soviet truck manufactured by GAZ. Its first prototypes were produced before the end of World War II, and mass production started in 1946.
A 2.5 ton 4×2 standard variant was joined in 1947 by almost identical 2 ton 4×4 GAZ-63. Both variants were powered by 70 hp (52 kW) 6-cylinder 3485 cc engine. GAZ-63s was manufactured with some changes until 1968 and production of GAZ-51 continued until 2 April 1975. The trucks were also manufactured under the Soviet license in Poland (as the Lublin-51), North Korea (as the Sungri-58) and China (as the Yuejin NJ-130).
