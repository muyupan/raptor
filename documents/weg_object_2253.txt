This document describes the K1 ARV South Korean Armored Recovery Vehicle.

The K1 ARV operated by a crew of four is equipped with the latest recovery equipment. Its advanced crane, winch and dozer systems allow it to perform damaged vehicle recovery missions, and to provide maintenance service for armored vehicles. The K1 ARV uses common components of the K1 MBT to the maximum extent which provides for effective maintenance and logistic support. It has the same mobility performances to keep up with the K1 main battle tanks so that overturned or partly destroyed armored vehicle can be rapidly recovered or towed to the maintenance units.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: South Korea (Republic of Korea).

Here is Variants information for the K1 ARV South Korean Armored Recovery Vehicle:

The K1M is Proposed export variant for Malaysia. In 1997, Malaysia expressed great interest in obtaining the K1, and the ROK responded by showing them the concept for K1M, which had several features not present in the baseline K1, including a laser warning system and an air conditioning unit. It was to weigh 49.7 tons, while the total ammunition capacity would have been reduced to 41 rounds. The ROK offered a contract for 210 K1M's, but Malaysia responded that it was too many, and chose to go with Polish PT-91M in 2003..
