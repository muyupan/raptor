This document describes the FV105 Sultan British Amphibious Command and Control Vehicle.

The FV105 Sultan is a British Army command and control vehicle based on the CVR(T) platform. It has a higher roof than the APC variants, providing a more comfortable "office space" inside. This contains a large vertical map board and desk along one side, with a bench seat for three people facing it. Forward of this are positions for the radio operator, with provision for four radios, and vehicle commander, whose seat can be raised to give him access to the pintle-mounted G.P.M.G. The driver sits forward of this in a small compartment beside the engine space, on a chair with a spring-loaded seat that allows him to recline inside the vehicle or sit upright with his head out of the hatch.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belgium, Honduras, Latvia, Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).
