Here is Variants information for the 3M-54 Kalibr (SS-N-27 Sizzler) Russian Short-Range Cruise Missile:
The 3M14K (SS-N-30A) is An inertial guidance land-attack variant deployed by the Russian Navy. The submarine-launched weapon has a basic length of 6.2 m (20 ft), with a 450 kg (990 lb) warhead. Its range is 2,500 km (1,600 mi), allowing the Russian Navy to strike targets throughout central Western Europe (including all of the UK, northern France including Paris, and most of Germany) from beyond the GIUK gap. Its subsonic terminal speed is Mach 0.8..
The 3M14T is The inertial guidance land-attack variant is deployed by the Russian Navy. A surface ship with VLS launched a missile, with a thrust vectoring booster, its basic length is 8.9 m (29 ft), and its warhead weight and other performance are the same as the 3M14K..
The 3M-14TE is An inertially guided, ship-launched, land-attack variant with VLS and a thrust vectoring booster. Its basic length is 8.9 m (29 ft), and its warhead weight and other performances are the same as the 3M-14E. Its subsonic terminal speed is 0.8 mach, with a range of 300 km (190 mi) at supersonic speed..
The 91RE1 is A submarine-launched anti-submarine variant, it consists of two stages, one solid booster with four grid fins and one anti-submarine light torpedo. Its basic length is 7.65 m (25.1 ft), it has a range of 50 km (31 mi). It can reach supersonic speed. The torpedo has warhead weight of 76 kg (168 lb). It is similar to the American ASROC/SUBROC missile/torpedo system. It follows a ballistic path on the surface, with a speed of Mach 2.5..
The 91RTE2 is The surface ship, VLS launched an anti-submarine variant; it consists of three stages, one booster with thrust vector nozzle, one conventional booster, and one anti-submarine light torpedo. Its basic length is 8.9 m (29 ft), with a range of 40 km (25 mi) at supersonic speed. The torpedo has warhead weight of 76 kg (168 lb). The lightest of all variants, with a launch weight of 1,300 kg (2,900 lb). Speed is Mach 2..
