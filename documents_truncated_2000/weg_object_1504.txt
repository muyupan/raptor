This document describes the BMP-2M Berezhok Russian Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The BMP-2M infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) is an upgraded version of the BMP-2 IFV. Designed and developed by Kurganmashzavod JSC, the IFV offers improved mobility and firepower for armed forces. The weapon system for the upgraded vehicle is provided by KBP Instrument Design Bureau.

The amphibious vehicle was displayed at an international forum known as Engineering Technologies 2010 held in June 2010 and KADEX-2012, Kazakhstan. The manufacturer also demonstrated the vehicle at Comprehensive Security Exhibition 2015 in Tampere.

KBP received an order from Algeria for the modernization of 360 BMP-2 vehicles to BMP-2M standard.

A total of 693 BMP-2/2K vehicles of the Indian Army are also being upgraded to the BMP-2M standard.

The Russian Defense Ministry placed a ten-year contract with KBP for the supply of 540 modernized BMP-2M and BMD-2 airborne vehicles in 2017.

The upgraded vehicle is being offered in two different configurations, which include BMP-2M (sb4-2) and BMP-2M (sb4-3).

The design of the BMP-2 M-tracked armored fighting vehicle is based on the BMP-2 IFV, which was commissioned by the Russian Army in 1980. Combat efficiency of the vehicle has been highly improved with advanced armament, while cross-country speed has also been increased.

The modernized vehicle can carry three crew members, including a driver, gunner, and commander. The troop compartment offers seating for up to seven soldiers.

The vehicle retains the design specifications of BMP-2, and measures 6.73m-long, 3.15m-wide, and 2.45-high. The combat weight of the vehicle is approximately 16,000kg.

The IFV is equipped with a KBM-2 air conditioning system to offer a comfortable environment to the crew when operating in high temperatures.

The BMP-2M IFV is equipped with a Berezhok (B05S011) combat module integrating four 9M133 Kornet series anti-tank guided missiles. The missiles are launched from the twin launchers mounted on either side of the turret.

The turret is also armed with a 30mm 2A42 automatic gun, a 7.62mm PKT coaxial machine gun, and a 30mm AG-17 automatic grenade launcher (AGL).

The 30mm cannon has the capability to fire 500 rounds of ammunition a minute, while the 7.62mm gun offers a rate of fire of 2,000 rounds a minute. The AGL can launch 250 grenades a minute for a maximum range of 1,730m.

The hull of the IFV is protected by applique armor, which enables the vehicle to withstand 12.7mm B-3232 rounds and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) missiles.

Observation and fire control
The BMP-2M IFV is equipped with a multi-channel optical system for the stabilization of view during firing. The vehicle has an advanced target detection system, a laser range-finder, and a thermal imaging system to improve the accuracy of target detection and mission efficiency.

An armament stabilizer and ballistic computer, as well as a BPK-3-42 gunner’s sight, are fitted to the vehicle to enable the firing of the main armament. The vehicle is also installed with a PL-1 laser illuminator.

The target detection ranges of the vehicle during the day and night are 5,000m and 3,000m respectively.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, India, Russian Federation.
