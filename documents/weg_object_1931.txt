This document describes the RPG-22 Netto Russian Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher.

The Soviet RPG-22 Netto is a one-shot disposable anti-tank rocket launcher first deployed in 1985, based on the RPG-18 rocket launcher, but firing a larger 72.5 mm fin-stabilized projectile. The weapon fires an unguided projectile, can be prepared to fire in around 10 seconds and can penetrate 400 mm of armor, 1.2 meters of brick, or 1 meter of reinforced concrete.

The smoothbore container is made from two fiberglass parts; the main tube containing the rocket, and a telescoping forward extension, which slides over the barrel.

In transport mode, both ends of the barrel are closed by plastic covers, which open when the weapon is extended. The firing mechanism is manually cocked by raising the rear sight. Lowering the rear sight de-cocks the weapon if there is no target.

On firing, there is a backblast danger area behind the weapon, of at least 15 meters. The solid propellant motor completely burns out while the rocket is still in the barrel tube, accelerating it to about 133 meters per second. The weapon has simple pop-up sights graduated to ranges of 50, 150, and 250 meters.

To keep training costs down, a reusable RPG-22 is available that fires a 30 mm subcalibre projectile, weighing 350g, to operational ranges. Handling is identical to that of the full caliber version, with the exception of the discharge noise and backblast.

On the evening of 20 September 2000, the MI6 Building in London (the headquarters of the British Secret Intelligence Service) was attacked by unapprehended forces using an RPG-22 anti-tank rocket, causing superficial damage.

A weapons cache destined for the Real IRA that was seized in Croatia in August 2000 contained a number of RPG-22s. Prices range from £150 to £220 per weapon. The one used against the MI6 building was Russian-made, while one found at Dungannon came from Bulgaria.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bulgaria, Colombia, Croatia, Georgia, India, Iraq, Moldova, Peru, Turkmenistan, Ukraine.
