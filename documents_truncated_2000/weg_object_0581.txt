This document describes the SH-1 Chinese 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The SH1 is a wheeled, self-propelled, 155mm howitzer designed and manufactured by the Chinese Defense Company, Norinco. Compared with other similar artillery systems, the SH1 has advantages such as a high mobility, greater fire-power, fast hit capability, modular design, and cost-effectiveness. The SH1 was presented for the first time to the public at the Defense Exhibition in Dubai, IDEX 2010.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Myanmar, Pakistan.

Here is Variants information for the SH-1 Chinese 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH):
The SH2 is The SH2 is a wheeled self-propelled howitzer designed and manufactured by the Chinese Defence Company Norinco. The SH2 artillery system was first unveiled at the Abu Dhabi International Defence Exhibition in 2007 (IDEX 2007) held between 18 and 22 February, and is being actively prompted to the export market. The lightweight and high-mobility features of this artillery system may be of special appeal to the PLA airborne force and marine corps. The SH2 has demonstrated superior performance under all weather conditions and a wide range of altitude, and it can be equipped with special gear as per mission requirement.

It is equipped with a digitised information system, which includes a gunner's terminal and digitised tactical radio so the system can be seamlessly integrated into a C4ISR system.

It also has an autonomous navigation and orientation system, digital command-and-control, and FCS.
