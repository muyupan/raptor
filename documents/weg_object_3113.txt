This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, France, Lithuania, Myanmar.

Here is Variants information for the AS 365N3+ French Medium Utility Helicopter:
The SA 365 C is A twin-engined version of the Dauphin, designated as the Dauphin 2, was announced in early 1973. The first prototype's first flight took place on 24 January 1975; production model deliveries began in December 1978. In comparison with the earlier model, the SA 365 C featured twin 470 kW (630 shp) Arriel 1 turboshafts in a new engine fairing, a Starflex main rotor hub and a higher maximum take-off weight (3,400 kg (7,496 lb) or 7,495 lb). Its Fenestron anti-torque device featured 13 metal blades. Production of both the SA 360 and SA 365 C ceased in 1981, by which time approximately 40 SA 360s and 50 SA 365 C/C1s had been built; both were replaced by the SA 365 N..
The SA 365 C1 is Variant powered by Arriel 1A1 certified in March 1979..
The SA 365 C2 is Variant powered by Arriel 1A2 certified in February 1980..
The SA 365 C3 is Variant powered by Arriel 1C certified in January 1982..
The SA 365 N is A much improved version of the SA 365 C Dauphin 2, the first prototype flying on 31 March 1979. This version introduced the uprated 492 kW (660 shp) Arriel 1C turboshafts, a retractable tricycle undercarriage, enlarged tail surfaces, and revised transmission, main rotor, rotor mast fairing and engine cowlings. The aircraft's initial M.T.O.W. of 3,850 kg (8,490 lb) was later raised to 4,000 kg (8,800 lb). Deliveries of the production model began in 1982..
The SA 365 N1 is Incorporating many of the improvements developed for the SA 366 G1 (HH-65 Dolphin), this version introduced upgraded 526 kW (705 shp) Arriel 1C1 turboshafts, an improved 11-blade Fenestron with wider-chord blades (which reduced the AS365 N1's noise signature), movable undercarriage doors replaced by simplified fairings and a higher gross weight of 4,100 kg (9,000 lb)..
The AS 365 N2 is This version – designated AS365 N2 from the outset – introduced the upgraded 549 kW (737 shp) Arriel 1C2 turboshafts, an uprated gearbox, increased maximum take-off weight of 4,250 kg (9,370 lb), redesigned cabin doors and revised interior, enlarged tail fin with all composite Fenestron. Deliveries of this version started in 1990. Licensed versions were assembled in China as the Z-9, Z-19 and AVIC AC312..
The AS365 N3 is The high-performance AS365 N3 was developed for operations in 'hot and high' climates, and introduced 635 kW (851 shp) Arriel 2C turboshafts equipped with a single channel DECU (Digital Engine Control Unit) with manual reversion, mated to an uprated main transmission for better single engine performance. The AS365 N3 also features a redesigned ten blade composite Fenestron anti-torque device with asymmetric blade distribution, offering a further reduction in noise signature. The AS365 N3's gross weight is 4,300 kg (9,500 lb). Production deliveries began in December 1998..
The AS365 N3+ is This version was presented at the 2009 Paris Air Show and differs mainly in new avionics including 4-axis auto-pilot This version is currently still in production..
The AS365 N4 is Produced as the EC155..
The AS365 X is Better known as the DGV 200 or Dauphin Grand Vitesse (High Speed Dauphin), the AS365 X was developed from the X-380 DTP (Developpement Technique Probatoire or Probatory Technical Development) testbed, first flown on 20 March 1989. The aircraft was first flown in the AS365 X configuration two years later in March 1991, and featured a smaller Fenestron, a new main rotor with five high-inertia blades with swept tips, a composite rotor hub/mast and 624 kW (837 shp) Turbomeca Arriel IX turboshafts. On 19 November 1991, this aircraft set a Class E1e (3,000 to 4,500 kg) speed record of 201 knots (372 km/h; 231 mph) over a 3 km (1.9 mi) triangular course..
The EC155 B/B1 is This version was originally to follow the N3 as the AS365 N4, and was announced at the 1997 Paris Airshow before being redesignated as the EC155 B. As with the N3 version, it has two Arriel 2C/2C2 turboshafts equipped with FADEC as well as a five blade Spheriflex main rotor (derived from the AS365 X DGV). It also features a 30% larger main cabin (achieved with bulged doors and cabin plugs). The first flight of the first prototype took place on 17 June 1997 and this version is currently in production (as the EC155 B1)..
The SA 366 G1 Dauphin is The SA 366 G1 Dauphin version was selected by the US Coast Guard (USCG) in 1979 as its new air-sea rescue helicopter and given the designation HH-65A Dolphin. In total 99 helicopters, optimized for the USCG's short-range recovery (SRR) search and rescue role, were initially acquired, with additional aircraft later procured..
The SA 365 N Dauphin is A much improved version of the SA 365 C Dauphin 2, the first prototype flying on 31 March 1979. This version introduced the upgraded 492 kW (660 shp) Arriel 1C turbo-shafts, a retractable tricycle undercarriage, enlarged tail surfaces, and revised transmission, main rotor, rotor mast fairing and engine cowlings. The aircraft's initial M.T.O.W. of 3,850 kg (8,490 lb) was later raised to 4,000 kg (8,800 lb). Deliveries of the production model began in 1982..
The SA 365 F Dauphin is The SA 365 F is a variant of the SA 365 N for the French Navy. It has been used since 1991 for general duties and for backup purposes aboard an aircraft carrier. A helicopter with rescue divers is always in the air during flight operations to be able to assist the pilot in case of an accident. First experiments were successfully carried out in 1990 on board the Clemenceau. The variant 365F is used since 1999 with Flottille 35F called AS365F Dauphin Pedro..
