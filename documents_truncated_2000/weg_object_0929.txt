This document describes the WZ-10 (Z-10) Chinese Attack Helicopter.

WZ-10 (Z-10) Chinese Attack Helicopter is an attack helicopter under development in China. It is designed primarily for anti-tank and battlefield interdiction operations, with a secondary air-to-air capability. It is said to be in the same class as the AgustaWestland A129 Mangusta, Denel Rooivalk, and Eurocopter Tiger.

The Z-10 has a conventional attack helicopter layout with the pilot and weapon system operator sitting in tandem, stepped cockpits. The helicopter has a five-blade main rotor and a four-blade tail rotor. It has two engines, each in a pod aft of the cockpit. The fuselage has sloped sides in a diamond configuration to reduce the aircraft's radar cross-section.

In September 2016, the PLA announced that all of its ground force aviation units had been equipped with the WZ-10.

The Kamov design bureau was contracted to perform the development work under a secret contract. Kamov worked with the Chinese to establish base specifications, such as weight, speed, and payload capacity after which they had full freedom to design the helicopter. Kamov designed, tested, and verified the helicopter design, after which it was provided to the Chinese team. Although designed in Russia, the prototype construction, flight testing, and further development were performed by the Chinese.

Wu Ximing (吴希明) of the 602nd Research Institute, one of the Chinese top scientists involved in the 863 Program was publicly credited with being the chief designer of the Z-10, in an attempt to preserve the secrecy of the Kamov contract. Wu had earlier participated in the designs of the armed version of transport helicopters Z-8A and WZ-9. In order to complete the necessary development, the 602nd Research Institute and CAIC had jointly built a new engineering design center, industrial simulator, aircraft engine ground test center, fatigue laboratory, and rotary test platform (nicknamed as Iron-Bird Platform, 铁鸟台). At the end of 2001, the final test was completed on the full-scale rotary test platform, paving the way for test flights.

Composite material is widely used in the Z-10 but China faced difficulties in this field, particularly in the area of survivability during crashes. Huge efforts were spent to domestically develop composite materials able to provide comparable levels of survivability to Western counterparts. This achievement earned second place in the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND) progress reward.

The main contractor of the avionics of Z-10 is the 613th Research Institute, which was responsible for integrating all of the avionics subsystems provided by subcontractors. Although foreign technologies are utilized (particularly French and Israeli, as rumored), this is limited to hardware only. All software applicable to Z-10 is completely indigenously developed by China on its own. Reportedly, the most time-consuming part of the software engineering for Z-10 was to develop all of the mathematic models needed for Z-10. Instead of using French standard DIGIBUS, Z-10 is built to Chinese GJV289A standard, the Chinese equivalent of MIL-STD-1553B. The adaptation of western military standards means that western weaponry can be readily deployed on Z-10, and the developer claims that all it needed was to add a module or interface to accomplish this. The ease of being compatible with multiple weaponry would also help to expand the export market of Z-10 in the future.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
