This document describes the Infauna (RB-531B) Russian 8x8 Amphibious Electronic Warfare System.

The Infauna (RB-531B) 8x8 Amphibious Electronic Warfare System is used to detect and jam the enemy communications, and to protect its own forces from the radio-controlled explosives. This happens through detection of the dangerous signal and jamming of that signal, by overpowering it. The system has been based on the K1SZ1 universal platform, derived from the BTR-80 APC.

“Infauna” is mainly becoming a part of the inventory of the Russian VDV airborne component. The first four examples of this suite have been handed off to the Western and Southern Military Districts at the beginning of the year 2012, with another two being delivered in 2014 and subsequent six systems received in 2015.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

Here is Main Weapons System information for the Infauna (RB-531B) Russian 8x8 Amphibious Electronic Warfare System:
The Note is There are no crew-served weapons mounted on the  Infauna (RB-531B) 8x8 Amphibious Electronic Warfare System.

Here is Protection information for the Infauna (RB-531B) Russian 8x8 Amphibious Electronic Warfare System:
The Hull Armor is The front of the vehicle is resistant to 12.7 mm rounds from an M2 at a range of 200 m, while the sides of the vehicle are resistant to 7.62 mm AP rounds. The hull is not thought to exceed 10 mm in thickness, however the majority of the armor is sloped, thereby increasing the level of protection offered..
The Applique Armor is It is possible to fit additional armor to the front of the  Infauna (RB-531B) 8x8 Amphibious Electronic Warfare System, which provides protection against 14.5 mm rounds and some resistance to blast damage. However, this would likely have a significant impact on the platform’s mobility..
The Explosive Reactive Armor is Available, Other armour kits have included ERA, thought to be added in the field by the crews in an effort to counter the effects of RPGs..
