This document describes the Type 52 Chinese 75mm Recoilless Rifle.

The Type 52 is a Chinese-produced an unlicensed copy of the American M20. 

The M20 recoilless rifle is a U.S. 75 mm caliber recoilless rifle T21E12 that was used during the last months of the Second World War and the M20 extensively during the Korean War. It could be fired from an M1917A1 .30 caliber machine gun tripod, or from a vehicle mount, typically a Jeep. Its shaped charge warhead, also known as HEAT, was capable of penetrating 100 mm of armor. Although the weapon proved ineffective against the T-34 tank during the Korean War and most other tanks, it was used primarily as a close infantry support weapon to engage all types of targets including infantry and lightly armored vehicles. The M20 proved useful against pillboxes and other types of field fortifications. Its poor armor penetration by the HEAT round was because of it being a spin-stabilized projectile rather than the later fin-stabilized rounds used in the 106mm M40 recoilless rifle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Burkina Faso, Burundi, China, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Myanmar, Pakistan, Tanzania, Togo, Viet Nam.
