This document describes the Boris Chilikin-Class (Project 1559V Morskoy Prostor Class) Russian Large Seagoing Tanker.

Boris Chilikin-Class (Project 1559V Morskoy Prostor Class) Russian Large Seagoing Tankers a series of fleet replenishment oilers built in the 1970s for the Soviet Navy and currently in service with the Russian Navy. As the Soviet Navy began to more regularly operate in large areas of the world's oceans and because of the emergence of the Kiev-class aircraft carriers, demand for large surface supply ships increased. In 1967, the TsKB "Baltsudoproyekt" (now Baltic Shipyard) received a technical and tactical assignment for the design of Project 1559V sea oilers based on the civilian Project 1559 or Velikiy Oktyabr class. The main designers were S.N. Shumilov and Captain 2nd rank Yu. D. Makshanchikov. The oilers of this class are equipped with a device for the transfer of goods in a move by the traverse method. This allows carrying out cargo operations during significant sea waves.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
