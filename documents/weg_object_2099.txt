This document describes the Sounder Norwegian Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV).

The Sounder Norwegian Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) supports quick and easy change of payload and is adaptable for both hull and bow-mounted systems. KONGSBERGâ€™s K-MATE autonomy system provides safe navigation and control of the system, is capable of direct remote control, and supervised or autonomous operation. A robust and reliable propulsion system and hull design ensure safe sailing for up to 20 days.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Norway.
