This document describes the T-64 Russian Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The T-64 (T-64B) is a Soviet second-generation main battle tank introduced in the early 1960s. It was a more advanced counterpart to the T-62: the T-64 served tank divisions, while the T-62 supported infantry in motorized rifle divisions. It introduced a number of advanced features including composite armor, a compact engine and transmission, and a smoothbore 125-mm gun equipped with an autoloader to allow the crew to be reduced to three so the tank could be smaller and lighter. In spite of being armed and armored like a heavy tank, the T-64 weighed only 38 tons (42 short tons; 37 long tons).

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Congo, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.
