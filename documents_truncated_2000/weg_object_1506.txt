This document describes the BTR-82 Russian 8x8 Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The BTR-82 armored personnel carrier is a latest version of the BTR-80 family. It is an improved version of the BTR-80A/S, which entered service back in 1994. It was developed largely as a complement (and a stop-gap) for a BTR-90, whose development has been long, troubled and expensive. The BTR-82 is similar to the BTR-80A/S but has some minor improvements. It was publicly revealed in 2009. In 2010 it successfully passed trials and production commenced during the same year. The original BTR-82 entered service with the Russian Army in 2011. However the original BTR-82 was not produced in large numbers as production soon switched to up gunned BTR-82A, which is used by the Russian military in large numbers. Since 2010 Russian Army stopped purchasing the older BTR-80 APCs. Currently the BTR-82 is being obtained as a temporarily measure, until a new-generation Bumerang armored personnel carrier is available. The BTR-82 and its variants has been exported to Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Syria, Turkmenistan, and possibly, some other countries.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, CFE Treaty, China, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Syria, Turkmenistan.
