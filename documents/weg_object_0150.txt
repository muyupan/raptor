This document describes the Grisha-Class (Project 1124 Class) Russian Anti-Submarine Corvette.

The Grisha-Class (Project 1124 Class) Russian Anti-Submarine Corvette are a series of anti-submarine corvettes built by the Soviet Union between 1970 and 1990 and later by Russia and Ukraine with newer, upgraded ships introduced in 2006. These ships have a limited range and are largely used only in coastal waters. They have been equipped with a variety of  Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) weapons and an SA-N-4 'Gecko' surface-to-air missile launcher. All were fitted with retractable fin stabilizers. The designation "corvette" for these ships was a conditional adaptation as the Soviet classification was a small anti-submarine ship. In the Russian Navy, the Grishas are expected to be partially replaced by the Steregushchiy-class corvette.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Georgia, Lithuania, Russian Federation, Ukraine.
