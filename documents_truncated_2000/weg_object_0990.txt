This document describes the JL-9 (FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle) Chinese Supersonic Advanced Attack Aircraft.

The Guizhou JL-9, also known as the FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle, is a two-seat supersonic fighter-trainer developed by the Guizhou Aviation Industry Import/Export Company (GAIEC) for the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF).

The FTC-2000 is a JJ-7/FT-7 with a new wing, a forward fuselage with side air intakes, and a glass cockpit. The engine, empennage, and mechanical controls of the JJ-7/FT-7 are retained.

The FTC-2000G is a multi-role combat fighter aircraft and one of the cheapest multirole fighters on the market with the aim to replace old legacy fighters like the J-7/F-7. It has 7 hardpoints. It also features a diverter less supersonic inlet. It made its first flight in September 2018. Compared to the FTC-2000 trainer variant, the FTC-2000G is heavier, slower due to new wing design, and has less endurance than the FTC-2000.

The JL-9G is a modified JL-9 for aircraft carrier training. It is designed for ski-jump ramp takeoffs and simulated arrested landings (land-based). and includes a tail hook.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
