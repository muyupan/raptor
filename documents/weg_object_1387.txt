This document describes the Borei-Class (Project 955 Borei Class) Russian Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine.

The Borei class, alternate transliteration Borey, Russian designation Project 955 Borei, and Project 955A Borei-A, also referred to as Dolgorukiy class, are series of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines being constructed by Sevmash for the Russian Navy. The class is projected to replace the Soviet-era Delta III, Delta IV, and Typhoon classes in Russian Navy service.

Despite being a replacement for many types of submarines, the Borei-class submarines are much smaller than those of the Typhoon class in both volume and crew (24,000 tons opposed to 48,000 tons and 107 people as opposed to 160 for the Typhoons) and are in terms of class more accurately a follow-on to for the Delta IV-class SSBNs.

The first design work on the project started in the mid-1980s and the construction of the first vessel started in 1996. Previously, a short-lived, smaller parallel design appeared in the 1980s with the designation Project 935 Borei II. A new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) called the R-39UTTH Bark was developed in parallel. However, the work on this missile was abandoned and a new missile, the RSM-56 Bulava, was designed. The submarine needed to be redesigned to accommodate the new missile, and the design name was changed to Project 955. The vessels were developed by Rubin Design Bureau are being built by Russia's Northern shipyard Sevmash in Severodvinsk. Because of the repeated failures during Bulava test launches, some experts suggested that the Borei submarines could instead be armed with R-29RMU Sineva SLBMs, already in active duty with the Delta IV-class submarines.

It has been reported that the arrival of the Borei class will enable the Russian Navy to resume strategic patrols in southern latitudes that have not seen a Russian missile submarine for 20 years.

Borei class includes a compact and integrated hydrodynamically efficient hull for reduced broadband noise and the first-ever use of pump-jet propulsion on a Russian nuclear submarine. The noise level is to be five times lower when compared to the third-generation nuclear-powered Akula-class submarines and two times lower than that of the U.S. Virginia-class submarines. The acoustic signature of Borey is significantly stealthier than that of the previous generations of Russian SSBNs, nevertheless, the USN has been able to identify the main noise emitter, i.e. the hydraulic pump. As the pump ages, it tends to become noisier, allowing for easier detection of the submarine.

The Borei submarines are approximately 170 meters (560 ft) long, 13 meters (43 ft) in diameter, and have a maximum submerged speed of at least 46 kilometers per hour (25 km; 29 mph). They are equipped with a floating rescue chamber designed to fit in the whole crew. Smaller than the Typhoon class, the Boreis were initially reported to carry 12 missiles but are able to carry four more due to the decrease in mass of the 36-ton Bulava SLBM (a modified version of the Topol-M ICBM) over the originally proposed R-39UTTH Bark. Cost is some ₽23 billion (USD$890 million), in comparison the cost of an Ohio-class SSBN was around US$2 billion per boat (1997 prices).

Each Borey includes 1.3 million units and mechanisms. Its construction requires 17 thousand tons of metal which are 50 % more than the Eiffel Tower. The total length of pipelines is 109 km and the length of cable routes is 600 km. 10 thousand rubber plates cover the hull of the boat.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

Here is Variants information for the Borei-Class (Project 955 Borei Class) Russian Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine:
The Project 955 (Borei Class) is Despite being a replacement for many types of SSBNs, Borei-class submarines are much smaller than those of the Typhoon class in both volume and crew (24,000 tons opposed to 48,000 tons and 107 personnel as opposed to 160 for the Typhoons). In terms of class, they are more accurately a follow-on for the Delta IV-class SSBNs. Borei class includes a compact and integrated hydrodynamically efficient hull for reduced broadband noise and the first-ever use of pump-jet propulsion on a Russian nuclear submarine. Russian news service TASS claimed the noise level is to be five times lower when compared to the third-generation nuclear-powered Akula-class submarines and two times lower than that of the U.S. Virginia-class submarines. The acoustic signature of Borei is significantly stealthier than that of the previous generations of Russian SSBNs, but it has been reported that their hydraulic pumps become noisier after a relatively short period of operation, reducing the stealth capabilities of the submarine..
The Project 955A (Borei-A Class) is Units of Project 955A include improved communication and detection systems, improved acoustic signature, and have major structural changes such as the addition of all moving rudders and vertical endplates to the hydroplanes for higher maneuverability, and a different sail geometry. Besides, they are equipped with hydraulic jets and improved screws that allow them to sail at nearly 30 knots while submerged with minimal noise. Although first reported to carry 20 Bulava SLBMs, the 955A will be armed with 16 SLBMs with 6-10 nuclear warheads atop each, just like the project 955 submarines.

The contract for five modified 955A submarines was delayed several times due to a price dispute between the Russian Defence Ministry and the United Shipbuilding Corporation. The contract was formally signed on 28 May 2012.

The first 955A submarine, Knyaz Vladimir, was laid down on 30 July 2012, during a ceremony attended by the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Two additional project 955A submarines were laid down in 2014, one in late 2015, and one in late 2016.

According to Sevmash official, Vitaliy Bukovskiy, all Borei-A submarines are to be equipped with aspen banyas able to accommodate 3-4 people..
The Project 955B (Borei-B Class) is Project 955B was expected to feature a new water jet propulsion system, an upgraded hull, and new noise reduction technology. The concept design was to be initiated by the Rubin Design Bureau in 2018 and four project 955B boats were been proposed with the first unit to be delivered to the Russian Navy in 2026. However, the project wasn't reportedly included in Russia's State Armament Programme for 2018–2027 due to cost-efficiency. Instead, six more Borei-A submarines were to be built after 2023. According to a 2018 report, Russia's State Armament Programme for 2018–2027 includes the construction of two more Borei-A submarines by 2028. The construction should take place at Sevmash starting in 2024 with deliveries to the Russian Navy in 2026 and 2027 respectively..
