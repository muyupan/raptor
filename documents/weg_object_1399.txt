This document describes the Priz-Class (Project 1855 Class) Russian Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle.

Priz-Class (Project 1855 Class) Russian Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles a type of Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) operated by the government of Russia. There are known to be at least five vessels of the class, several of which were involved in the failed rescue attempt when the Kursk sank on 12 August 2000. The Russian word "Priz" (“приз”) means "prize". The Priz is thought to be operable either manned or unmanned with a battery endurance of three hours. Over the 2006-2016 years, an upgrade of the class to improve its navigational, search, and life-support ability was conducted.

The Priz submarines are carried by Pionier Moskvyy class submersible support ships (Project 05360/05361), which can carry up to two of the submarines. The ships are equipped with special equipment to deploy Priz in rough seas.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

The Note is A Project 1855 Priz Deep-Diving Rescue Vehicle was involved in the Kursk accident. It was much-needed in the aftermath of the accident with Kursk submarine. On the morning of 13 August 2000, the submarine of the Main Intelligence Department investigated the KURSK bow. At 18:00 and 18:30 were carried out the first two descents of a diving bell from ALTAY rescue ship. At 19:30 Project 1855 DSRV from MIKHAIL RUDNITSKIY discovered by sight the submarine laid on the seabed.

At night on 15 August 2000, the Kursk submarine's bow was inspected for the first time by a deep submergence vehicle, which obtained data about the damage to the bow. It was determined that two fore compartments had been flooded. The next morning the rescue operation was temporarily halted the storm that had begun that night. Only when the weather had improved did the attempts of diving and docking of DSRV were started with two PRIZ-type vehicles. The first diving lasted from 20:00 till 5:30 (four unsuccessful docking attempts). That day the surviving crew members of the Kursk stopped sending distress signals..
