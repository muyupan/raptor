This document describes the R-330B Russian VHF Frequency Jamming System.

Hezbollah Proliferation. The upgraded R-330B/R-330T VHF jamming system is designed for detection, direction-finding, and jamming of VHF communication facilities operated at tactical command level at fixed frequencies with conventional waveforms, in programmed and automatic frequency tuning modes, as well as for transmitting short encoded messages. The jamming system provides analysis and selection of emittersâ€™ signal parameters.

The R-330B/R-330T VHF jamming system consists of an equipment vehicle on a wheeled (R-330T) or tracked (R-330B) chassis, a diesel-electric power station mounted on a two-axle trailer (R-330T), or MT-Lbu armored tracked chassis (R-330B), a set of operational documentation, and a single spare part, tools, and accessories set.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Non-State Actors, Russian Federation.
