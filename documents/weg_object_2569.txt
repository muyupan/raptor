This document describes the ZBD-03 (Type 03) Chinese Airborne Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The ZBD-03 or Type 03 (industrial designation WZ506) is a Chinese airborne infantry fighting vehicle. It features a light-weight chassis and hydro-pneumatic suspension for airborne operations. The ZBD-03 bears some external resemblance to the BMD-3, particularly with regards to its main armament. However, the chassis and internal subsystems possess a different layout. The ZBD-03 retains the Russian parachute system for landing from an Il-76 transport aircraft. The ZBD-03 has a crew of three (a commander, a driver, and a gunner) and is able to carry five infantry passengers in a troop compartment.

The ZBD-03 bears some external resemblance to the BMD-3, particularly with regards to its main armament. However, the chassis and internal subsystems possess a different layout. The ZBD-03 retains the Russian parachute system for landing from an Il-76 transport aircraft. The ZBD-03 has a crew of three (a commander, a driver, and a gunner) and is able to carry five infantry passengers in a troop compartment. The gunner is seated in the single-man turret located in the middle of the chassis. The driver and commander are located in tandem to the left of the power compartment in the front right of the chassis. The troop compartment is located in the rear with two overhead hatches and a rear exit.

The suspension system of ZBD-03 consists of five lightweight road wheels and three return rollers with a front-mounted drive sprocket. The hydro-pneumatic suspension has variable ground clearance, minimum exhibited in the commission of landing the plane in order to reduce the force of impact on the ground.

The ZBD-03 is equipped with a single-man turret with a 30mm gun capable of firing an armor-piercing round. A missile rail launcher at the top of the turret is included as part of the HJ-73C anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). Secondary weaponry includes a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun and three smoke grenade dischargers mounted to each side of the turret.

The ZBD-03 armor protection is limited by the weight restrictions necessary for airdropping. With a combat weight of 8 tonnes, the vehicle’s armor is thin and sloped to maximize resistance to small-caliber weapons.

The gunner has a day/night thermal scope and an emergency backup day sight. The gun system is fully stabilized. The driver and commander have their own observation instruments installed on the hatch.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the ZBD-03 (Type 03) Chinese Airborne Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV):
The ZLC-2000 is The ZLC-2000 has been in service with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) Airborne Corps since 2003.

China decided to develop the ZLC-2000 in the late 1990s after a failure to reach agreement with Russia over the purchase or licensed-production of BMD-series vehicles. The first prototype is thought to have been delivered in 2003.

Development of the K/STW-17 vehicle air dropping system was completed in 2004. The ZLC-2000 was first seen in operational service in 2005 and was noted as a participant in the Peace Mission 2005 exercise with Russia.
