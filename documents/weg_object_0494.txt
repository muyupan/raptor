This document describes the T-12 (2A19) Russian 100mm Towed Anti-Tank Gun.

2A19 or T-12 is a Soviet smoothbore 100-mm anti-tank gun, which served as the primary towed anti-tank artillery in the Soviet and Bulgarian armies from the early 1960s to the late 1980s.

The T-12 entered service in 1961, replacing the BS-3 100 mm field gun. It was typically deployed in the anti-tank units of armored and motor rifle regiments to protect flanks against counter-attacks during rapid advances.

In 1970, it was replaced in production by the T-12A or MT-12 "Rapira", which features a new smoothbore gun, the 100 mm 2A29 gun, as well as a redesigned carriage and gun shield to protect the crew from machine-gun fire and shell splinters. Thanks to the redesigned carriage, which has a bigger wheelbase, the MT-12 can be towed by the MT-LB, at speeds up to 60 km/h on-road or 25 km/h cross-country.

The 2A29R "Ruta" or MT-12R is a version with an RLPK-1 radar for engaging targets in a poor visibility environment (smoke/fog). From 1981, the gun could fire laser beam-riding guided missiles 9M117 Kastet (weapon system 9K116) and carried the new designator 2A29K "Kastet" or MT-12K.

The weapon was planned to be superseded by the 2A45 Sprut-B 125 mm smoothbore anti-tank gun. Modern western tanks' frontal armor protection is in excess of what can be penetrated by a 100 mm gun from anything but a point-blank range – even using the most modern APFSDS round. For a tank that can maneuver to take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses, this is less of a problem – but for a weapon that is primarily defensive, this is a serious problem. Today, the T-12 is applied mostly in the role of ordinary artillery, using FRAG-HE shells.

In 2017, the Algerian military displayed a locally developed variant mounted on a Mercedes-Benz Zetros truck. It includes four stabilization legs to absorb firing impacts.

The gun requires a crew of six: commander, driver of the towing vehicle, gun layer, loader, and two ammunition crewmen. When the MT-LB is used as the transporter, 20 rounds are typically carried (10 APFSDS, 4 HE-Frag, 6 HEAT). Since the weapon is a smoothbore, all the ammunition is finned for accuracy during flight.

The standard equipment consists of the panoramic PG-1M sight for indirect fire and an OP4M-40U telescope for direct fire. The APN-5-40 or APN-6-40 are used for direct fire by night.

The gun can be fitted with the LO-7 ski gear for travel across snow or swampy ground.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, CFE Treaty, China, Croatia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Russian Federation, Serbia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam.

Here is Variants information for the T-12 (2A19) Russian 100mm Towed Anti-Tank Gun:
The T-12 is Anti-tank gun and suppressive artillery fire. The T-12 comprises of the 100 mm barrel and breech ring, semi-automatic breech, top carriage with sight and lower carriage. The actual mount used in the T-12 is the same as that used in the D-48 rifled ATG..
The MT-12 is The main difference between the T-12 and the MT-12 is the new carriage. The former was normally towed by a truck whereas the MT-12 is towed by a MT-LB multipurpose tracked armoured vehicle..
The MT-12R/MT-12K is The MT-12R was equipped with a RLPK-1 radar for engaging targets in low visibility conditions. The ATG got its alternative designation as MT-12K because of its ability to fire the 9M117 Kastet missile..
