This document describes the 2S4 Tyulpan (M-1975) Russian 240mm Self-Propelled Heavy Mortar.

2S4 Tyulpan (M-1975) 240mm Self-Propelled Heavy Mortar is the largest mortar system in use today. The 2S4 Tyulpan design is based on the GM-123 chassis carrying an externally mounted M-240 240 mm breech-loading mortar on the rear of the hull. The 2S4 uses an autoloader of the sort. It has two automated drum-type magazines, capable of holding up to 40 standard high-explosive rounds or 20 long-range rocket-assisted rounds. The rounds are fed to the top of the carrier, where they are placed on a track. The mortar then tilts to the horizontal position. The breech opens and a ramming device pushes the round into the breach. The breach closes and the mortar tilts into the firing position.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: CFE Treaty, Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine.
