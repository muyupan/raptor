This document describes the BMP-3 Russian Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The BMP-3 [BMP = Boyevaya Mashina Pyekhota - Infantry Fighting Vehicle], which represents a totally different design concept from BMP-1/2, is a light tank that can hold a squad of infantry. It has a 100 mm main gun that fires HE to demolish buildings, can fire long-range ATGMs through its barrel, and a 30 mm autocannon and a medium machine gun as a single unit in the turret. The innovative BMP-3 armament suite has been subjected to criticism in the Russian military, which has focused on deficiencies in the barrel-fired ATGM. The performance obtained from the 500 horsepower engine powering this 18 ton of vehicle compares favorably to the American Bradley, which has an engine of similar power for a 33 ton of vehicle. The BMP-3, first seen in public during a parade in Moscow in 1990, was built by Kurganmashzavod, developer, and manufacturer of the BMP-2 infantry combat vehicle. The hull of the BMP-3 resembles the BMD Airborne Infantry Fighting Vehicle, with a new turret in the center of the vehicle. The troop compartment at the rear of the hull is accessed via a pair of doors in the hull rear. The BMP-3 is fully amphibious, propelled in the water by two water jets mounted at the rear of the hull.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, CFE Treaty, Cyprus, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kurdistan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Russian Federation, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Sri Lanka, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).
