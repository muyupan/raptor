This document describes the MTU-90 Russian Armored Vehicle-Launched Bridge (AVLB) System.

The MTU-90 armored bridge layer is designed to carry and lay a one-span bridge over narrow gaps (ditches, canals and rivers) on the battlefield.

The vehicle is mounted on a T-90S chassis supporting the single-span and supports the TMM-6 Heavy Bridge Building System.

The MTU-90 is capable of basic water-crossing operations as well as self-entrenchment. It is equipped with NBC protection systems, fire extinguishers, and a smoke-screen system.

The vehicle also has a night-vision device, as well as protection against armor-piercing, incendiary and hollow-charge projectiles.

The bridge has a length of 25m, a width of 3.52 m, and is capable of supporting 50,000 kg.  The vehicle is capable of deploying its single span within 2.5 minutes. The crew can deploy the bridge without leaving the cabin.

This vehicle can also work in support of the TMM-6 Heavy Bridge Building System.  It is capable of laying multi-span bridges for the passage of tanks and wheeled vehicles.

The vehicleâ€™s capabilities are similar to those of the U.S. Wolverine, indicating the MTU-90 may be a derivative design.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, CFE Treaty, Russian Federation, Uzbekistan.
