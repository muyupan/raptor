This document describes the BL-904 (Type 704) Chinese Artillery Location and Fire Correction Radar.

The BL-904 is the artillery locating radar developed by China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO). The radar system is based on the phased-array radar (PAR) technology and was developed as a part of the Plz-45 155mm self-propelled howitzer system. Operating in the C-band, the radar can detect the trajectory of enemy mortar bombs, howitzer projectiles and rockets, and can also be used to correct the own-side artillery fire. The radar has a response time of 5 seconds, and its performance is said to be comparable to the U.S. TPQ-36.

A complete BL-904 radar system consists of two 6X6 trucks, one carrying the phased-array radar antenna and the other carries the operation center. The system takes 10 minutes to be ready for operation. The radar’s vertical range of detection is –5 to +12 degrees and the azimuth range of detection is 180 degrees. The system has a maximum detection range of 15km (for mortar bomb) and 18km (for 122/152/155mm howitzer projectile and 122mm rocket), and can track eight targets simultaneously. It is also equipped with the GPS and can transmit the target information to the battery command post in real-time.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
