This document describes the PP-Mi-Sr II Czechoslovakian Anti-Personnel Mine.

PP Mi-Sr II is a newer version of the same landmine with minor modifications.

This bounding fragmentation landmine can be used as a pressure-actuated landmine with a RO-8 fuze or as a tripwire actuated landmine with an RO-1 fuze.

The landmine is cylindrical in shape with a centrally located fuze well on top.

On the top surface, there are two slotted screw heads and a central fuze well.

The larger of the screws is the filler plug, while the smaller one seals the detonator into position.

Beneath the central fuze well is a tube, which houses a delay element and propelling charge.

This well is covered by a transit cap until the landmine is armed.
