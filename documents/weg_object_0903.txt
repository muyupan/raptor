This document describes the BO-105 German Light Utility Helicopter.

The Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105 is a light, twin-engine, multi-purpose helicopter developed by Bölkow of Ottobrunn, West Germany. It was the first light twin-engine helicopter in the world, and the first rotorcraft that could perform aerobatic maneuvers such as inverted loops.[5][6] The Bo 105 features a revolutionary hingeless rotor system, at that time a pioneering innovation in helicopters when it was introduced into service in 1970. Production of the Bo 105 began at the then-recently merged Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB).

The BO105 is considered a rugged, time-proven design. It is easily maintained in the field and is highly maneuverable in flight due to a unique hingeless main rotor system. The compact cabin has a flat floor, rear clamshell doors and provides excellent visibility for the pilot.

The main production facilities for producing the Bo 105 were located in Germany and Canada; due to the level of export sales encountered, additional manufacturing lines were set up in Spain, Indonesia, and the Philippines.[7] MBB became a part of Eurocopter in 1991, who continued production of the type until 2001. The Bo 105 was formally replaced in Eurocopter's product range by the newer Eurocopter EC135, which was itself a development of the Bo 105.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Albania, Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Spain, Uruguay.
