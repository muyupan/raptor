This document describes the GSL-130 (WZ763) Chinese Tracked Comprehensive Mine Clearing Vehicle (TCMCV).

The PLA operates the GSL-130 Chinese Tracked Comprehensive Mine Clearing Vehicle (TCMCV),
which is based on the older Type 59/Type 69 MBT hull. This system is also referred to as the
WZ763. The turret has been removed and replaced by an armored superstructure for the crew of
three and mounted at the front is a hydraulically operated full-width mine plow clearing system,
which includes a depth-sensing device that is lifted while traveling.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Myanmar.
