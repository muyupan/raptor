This document describes the PFM-1 (Green Parrot) Russian Anti-Personnel Mine.

PFM-1 (Green Parrot) Russian Anti-Personnel Mine is a liquid high explosive (HE), plastic, scatterable, anti-personnel blast landmine sometimes known as the butterfly landmine.

In Afghanistan, the PFM-1 is known as the Green Parrot.

The PFM-1 has a plastic body and is filled with approximately 37grams of liquid explosive.

The fuze is hydraulic pressure operated and incorporates an arming delay.

The landmine is normally colored green, Khaki brown, or sand-brown.

The landmine has a thin wing and a thicker wing with the thicker wing containing the liquid explosive.

The PFM-1 landmine is a reverse-engineered copy of the American BLU-43.

A self-destruct variant of this landmine, the PFM-1S, is intended to randomly self-destruct over a period of time.

A PFM-1 training landmine is distinguishable from the live version by the presence of the Cyrillic character Ð£ cut into the plastic.

While the nominal period for 85% self-destruct is 40 hours, the landmine remains functional for far longer.

Additional images and technical information are available to CAT-UXO members.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Russian Federation.
