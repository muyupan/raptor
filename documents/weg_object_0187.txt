This document describes the 1L220-U (Zoopark-2) Ukrainian Artillery Locating Radar.

A Ukrainian export company reported the Ukrainian army would begin receiving the 1L220-U (NATO: Zoopark 2) in 1999. The Artillery Locating Radar (ALR) has the capability of detecting mortars, cannon artillery, rocket, and tactical missile batteries. It can estimate the impact points of hostile fires as well as register friendly artillery. The ALR has an internal navigation and orientation system to enable autonomous operations and is equipped with a communications suite for command and control.
