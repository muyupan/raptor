This document describes the M1167 HMMWV American 4x4 Expanded Capacity TOW Armament Carrier.

The M1167 was a TOW missile carrier configuration in the Expanded Capacity HMMWV series. The M1167 was equipped with an M41 Improved Target Acquisition system (ITAS) used to mount and operate the missile launcher system and featured armor ballistic protection for crew, missile stowage, secondary weapons mount for close range, and ammunition. These tactical vehicles were designed for use over all types of roads, as well as cross-country terrain, in all weather conditions. All vehicles were able to stow a minimum of 6 missiles mounted in the cargo area and are equipped with a pintle hook for towing, tiedowns, and lifting eyes for air, rail, or sea shipment. The optional front self-recovery winch permitted recovery operations of similar vehicles.

Fully loaded M1167s could climb road grades as steep as 40 percent (22 degrees) and traverse a side slope of up to 30 percent (13.5 degrees). The vehicle could ford hard bottom water crossings up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) without a deep water fording kit and 60 inches (152 centimeters) with the kit.

The primary difference between the M1167 and the M1115, was that the M1167 featured a slightly lower default armor package based on the Integrated Armor Protection package (or A-Kit) for the M1151A1/M1152A1/M1165A1 type vehicles, but was capable of mounting the supplemental armor (B-Kits). Frag Kits could also be installed. These vehicles reflected the US Army's Long Term Armor Strategy of developing vehicles with adaptable armor packages.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chile, Colombia, Djibouti, Ecuador, Greece, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Mexico, Morocco, Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sudan, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates.
