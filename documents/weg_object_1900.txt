This document describes the Bittium Tactical Wireless IP Network (TAC WIN) Finnish High-Data-Rate Wireless IP Network.

With the Software Defined Radio (SDR) based Bittium Tactical Wireless IP Network (TAC WIN) battlegroups can create high-data-rate wireless IP networks as a backbone to support command and control (C2) data transmission during military operations. Compared to existing tactical data link networks, flexibility to use the Bittium solution in different frequency bands and network structures provides cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and efficiency.

Bittium TAC WIN network can be deployed in any location. It enables the formation of an independent IP network and is compatible with existing infrastructure, both wire-line and wireless.

As it is software-defined, the system is versatile, can be easily upgraded, and is easy to adapt. The system enables a mesh network solution with high data rates and automatic network configuration required by battlegroups on the move.

Bittium TAC WIN has excellent performance and form factor as both network node and router functionalities are integrated into a single product.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Estonia, Finland.
