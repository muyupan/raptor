This document describes the Type 65 Chinese 37mm Twin-Barrel Anti-Aircraft Gun.

The Type 65 is the twin-37mm towed anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) developed in the 1960s as a successor to the Soviet M1939 single-barrel 37mm AAA (produced in China as Type 55). The weapon was designed primarily to engage airborne targets within a distance of 8,500m (or slant range of 3,500m), but it can also be used against land or water surface targets. Based on the Type 65 design, the PLA developed a number of derivations including the Type 74/74SD towed AAA, Type 79-III towed AAA, Type 76 shipboard AAA, and Type 88 self-propelled AAA.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bangladesh, China.

Here is Fire Control information for the Type 65 Chinese 37mm Twin-Barrel Anti-Aircraft Gun:
The Description is Sights w/magnification:  optical mechanical computing sight 
Azimuth warning receiver:  1l15-1 
Off-carriage radar:  Optional.  The Chinese Type 311 continuous wave I/J-band fire control radar was designed and produced to support 37mm and 57mm guns.  The trailer-mount radar with computer automation can conduct surveillance and target acquisition.  It has at least three variants, with ranges of 30km (311-A), 35km (311-B), and 40km (311-C).
