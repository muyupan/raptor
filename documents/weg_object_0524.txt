This document describes the Caesar French 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzer (SPH).

The CAESAR 8x8 self-propelled howitzer was developed by Nexter. Sometimes this artillery system is referred as CAESAR 2. The acronym CAESAR stands for CAmion Equipe d'un Systeme d'ARtillerie, or truck equipped with an artillery system. It is based on the original CAESAR, which first appeared back in 1994 and was the first mass produced truck-mounted howitzer. Prototype of the CAESAR with 8x8 configuration was revealed in 2015. The new artillery system, which emerged more than 20 years after its predecessor, is based on an 8x8 chassis. Gun of the new artillery system remains without significant changes, however weapon control systems have been updated. So the CAESAR 8x8 can shoot faster and is more accurate than its predecessor. In 2017 Denmark selected this artillery system to replace their old M109 howitzers that are in service since 1965.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: France, Indonesia, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Thailand.
