This document describes the B737-300 (Boeing 737-300) American Cargo Transport Aircraft.

Boeing engineer Mark Gregoire led a design team, which cooperated with CFM International to select, modify and deploy a new engine and nacelle that would make the 737-300 into a viable aircraft. They chose the CFM56-3B-1 high-bypass turbofan engine to power the aircraft, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise, but also posed an engineering challenge, given the low ground clearance of the 737 and the larger diameter of the engine over the original Pratt & Whitney engines. Gregoire's team and CFM solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan (which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be), placing the engine ahead of the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides of the engine pod, giving the engine a distinctive non-circular "hamster pouch" air intake. Earlier customers for the CFM56 included the U.S. Air Force with its program to re-engine KC-135 tankers.

The passenger capacity of the aircraft was increased to 149 by extending the fuselage around the wing by 9 feet 5 inches (2.87 m). The wing incorporated several changes for improved aerodynamics. The wingtip was extended 9 in (23 cm), and the wingspan by 1 ft 9 in (53 cm). The leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps were adjusted. The tailfin was redesigned, the flight deck was improved with the optional EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrumentation System), and the passenger cabin incorporated improvements similar to those developed on the Boeing 757. The prototype âˆ’300, the 1,001st 737 built, first flew on February 24, 1984 with pilot Jim McRoberts. It and two production aircraft flew a nine-month-long certification program.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the B737-300 (Boeing 737-300) American Cargo Transport Aircraft:
The B737-100 is This is the initial production civil airliner version, with a 94-ft (28.65-m) long fuselage and a maximum passenger capacity of 115.
First flight took place on April 9, 1967. Only 30 were built, all of which entered commercial service. One was later acquired by the Mexican air force as a VIP transport..
The B737-200 is This version features a 6-ft (1.82-m) fuselage stretch and more powerful JT8D engines. There were 1,095 aircraft built..
The B737-2X9 Surveiller is This version is a 737-200 with 14 first-class and 88 coach passenger seats as well as a Motorola side-looking airborne modular multi-mission radar (SLAMMR) -- a variant of the AN/APS-131/135 radar -- and two associated 16-ft (5-m) long slotted waveguide antennas on the upper rear fuselage sides.
At 30,000 ft (9,144 m), the detection range for small ships is 100 nm (115 mi; 185 km). Three improved Surveillers are in service in Indonesia. Modifications to the Indonesian versions include enhanced side-looking airborne modular radar; a new nose-mounted IR-detection system; as well as radar and GPS. Also installed on the improved version is the Boeing-developed data processing and display system (DPDS)..
The B737-300 is The B737-300 is the extended-range version with stretched fuselage and quieter, more fuel-efficient CFM56-3-B engines.
First flight occurred on Aug. 24, 1984; it entered service on Dec. 7, 1984. More than 850 were ordered.

One each has been in VIP service with the South Korean and Thai air forces..
The B737-400 is This variant is similar to the B737-30, but with additional 10-ft (3.05-m) stretch to fuselage, 168-passenger capacity and higher rated engines.
First flight occurred on Feb. 19, 1988; the first was delivered on Sept. 15, 1988. More than 170 were ordered..
The B737-500 is The B737-500 is a short-fuselage (101 ft 9 in/31.01 m) version of the B737-300 with a passenger capacity of 132.
First flight took place on June 30, 1989. More than 165 were ordered..
The B737-600 is The B737-600 was known as the 737-500X prior to 1995. It accommodates 108-140 passengers. It is part of the Next Generation series -- the smallest model. The wings have increased chord and span lending more fuel capacity, better fuel efficiency and a longer range..
The B737-700 is Launched in November 1993, this was the first of the Next Generation series to enter service. It accommodates 128-149 passengers. The aircraft is similar to the B737-600, though the wings have increased chord and span, lending more fuel capacity, better fuel efficiency and a longer range..
The B737-700 Increased Gross Weight Quick Change is This variant was chosen by the U.S. Navy to replace the C-98s in the Reserves. Its features include continuous double-slotted flaps, new leading-edge slats and a large cargo door fitted to the front fuselage. Two were ordered for delivery by the end of 2001. A commercial version has not been made available..
The B737-800 is The B737-800 was launched on Sept. 5, 1994. It is the longest variant of this series; it has a seating accommodation of 162-189 passengers..
The B737-900 is This is a stretched version that can accommodate 18 more passengers than the 737-800. At least 10 orders have been placed for this aircraft.
The eyebrow windows located above the cockpit windscreen were removed in January 2005. Kits are available to remove the eyebrow windows from earlier 737-900s.
