This document describes the CB-90 Class Swedish Fast Assault Craft.

Combat Boat 90 (CB-90) can carry and deploy a half platoon of amphibious infantry (18 men) fully equipped) is a class of fast military assault craft originally developed for the Swedish Navy by Dockstavarvet. In addition to the many variants in service with the Swedish Navy under the "Stridsbåt 90H" designation, the CB 90 has been adopted by the navies of several countries, including Norway (as the S90N), Greece, Mexico (as the CB 90 HMN), the United States (as the Riverine Command Boat) and Malaysia. Additionally, the German Navy plans to equip the Berlin-class replenishment ships with the CB90.

The CB90 is an exceptionally fast and agile boat that can execute extremely sharp turns at high speed, decelerate from top speed to a full stop in 2.5 boat lengths, and adjust both its pitch and roll angle while underway. Its lightweight, shallow draught, and twin water jets allow it to operate at speeds of up to 40 knots (74 km/h) in shallow coastal waters. The water jets are partially ducted, which, along with underwater control surfaces similar to a submarine's diving planes, gives the CB90 its maneuverability.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Estonia, Greece, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the CB-90 Class Swedish Fast Assault Craft:
The The Strb 90 L is The Strb 90 L is outfitted for battalion-level command and control, with computer and communications equipment and an auxiliary generator to provide electrical power when the engines are not running. The L stands for ledning (command or leadership)..
The The Strb 90 KompL is The Strb 90 KompL is a plain Strb 90 H in which portable computer and communications equipment has been installed, allowing it to temporarily provide company-level command and control. Electrical power is provided by a rather loud portable generator installed on deck..
The The Strb 90 HS is is designed for overseas peace-keeping and rescue operations.

The SB90N is The Royal Norwegian Navy operates 20 CB90s under the designation SB90N; the N simply stands for Norsk utgave (Norwegian version). The S90N differs from the Strb 90 H in a few areas:

*It is armed with only one 12.7 mm machine gun, instead of three.
*The anchor winch is motorized, and the anchor is mounted at the stern, allowing a grounded S90N to tow itself afloat rather than risk damage to its impellers.
It carries an auxiliary generator that provides electrical power to navigation and communications systems even when the engines are not running.
The "Troops transportation room" has a higher deck height, making it possible for most people to stand without crouching.
It has two water-tight compartments in the bow, having an extra room for toilet and stores.
It has much more sophisticated navigation equipment based on GPS technology delivered by Kongsberg Seatex AS..
