This document describes the Buk-M2 (SA-17 Grizzly) Russian Medium-Range Air Defense Missile System.

The Buk-M2 (NATO name SA-17 Grizzly, Russian name 9K317) is a Russian-made mobile medium-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) system designed to defend field troops and logistical installations against air threats. SA-17 Grizzly is an upgraded version of the proven Buk-M1 mobile air defense system and retains its main features. It defeats strategic and tactical aircraft, tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, air-launched missiles, guided aerial bombs, and helicopters, including hovering rotorcraft, in the presence of heavy electronic countermeasures and under intense enemy fire. Moreover, it can be used against sea-surface and ground targets. 

The Buk-M2E SAM system includes combat elements, such as a target-acquisition radar, a battle management station, self-propelled firing vehicles, illumination and guidance radar, loader-launcher vehicles, and surface-to-air guided missiles, as well as maintenance and repair facilities. The combat elements can be mounted either on tracked or wheeled chassis. Wheeled trucks carry the maintenance facilities. The Buk-M2 can engage a wide variety of targets from aircraft to missiles flying at an altitude of between 10 and 24,000 m out of a maximum range of 50 km in given conditions.

The SA-17 Grizzly can engage simultaneous up to 24 targets flying from any direction.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Egypt, Georgia, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).

Here is Variants information for the Buk-M2 (SA-17 Grizzly) Russian Medium-Range Air Defense Missile System:
The Buk System Components is The Buk system has numerous variants and the family has various branches for user modifications or copies. Typically, however, most of the variants consist of the following components:
