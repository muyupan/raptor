This document describes the 96K6 Pantsir-S1 (SA-22 Greyhound) Russian Short-Range Air Defense Gun/Missile System.

The 96K6 Pantsir-S1 (SA-22 Greyhound) Russian Short-Range Air Defense Gun/Missile System is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun and missile (SPAAGM) system designed by Russia. The Pantsir air defense system incorporates anti-aircraft guns and missiles to intercept tactical aircraft, precision-guided munitions (PGMs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Although each Pantsir launch vehicle is capable of functioning independently, they typically operate in batteries of six launcher vehicles and are occasionally accompanied by a separate command and control vehicle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jordan, Oman, Russian Federation, Serbia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Viet Nam.
