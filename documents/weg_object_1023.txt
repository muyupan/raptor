This document describes the J-11BS (Flanker-L) Chinese Air Superiority Fighter.

J-11BS – A twin-seat version of the J-11B. In 2012, the number of J-11B and J-11BS in service was over 120.

The Shenyang J-11 (Chinese: 歼-11), with NATO reporting name Flanker-L, is a twin-engine jet fighter, whose airframe is based on the Soviet-designed Sukhoi Su-27 air superiority fighter. It is currently manufactured by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation. The aircraft is operated by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) of China (PRC).

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the J-11BS (Flanker-L) Chinese Air Superiority Fighter:
The J-11A is Chinese/Russian assembled Su-27SK from Russian-made kits. 104 were built. They were later upgraded with MAWS. Unconfirmed upgrades include improved cockpit displays, and fire control systems for R-77 or PL-10 missiles. It is also called J-11..
The J-11B is An indigenously produced version using Chinese technology, and the first J-11 variant to use the WS-10A turbofan. The airframe is slightly lighter due to the greater use of composites. It has new avionics, a glass cockpit, MAWS, and an onboard oxygen generator system. Upgrading to AESA radar may have been planned. Photos of China's latest, very long-range PL-15 missile on a J-11B may well indicate the undergoing upgrades of AESA radar to the aircraft. More recently aircraft have been spotted with light grey radomes which may indicate ongoing upgrades..
