This document describes the Type 052D Class (Luyang III-Class) Chinese Destroyer.

The LUYANG III incorporates the PLA Navy’s first multipurpose vertical launch system, likely capable of launching ASCM, land attack cruise missiles (LACM), surface-to-air missiles (SAM), and anti-submarine rockets.

One source reported that "Type 052D DDG ... will be a 10,000 ton destroyer, upgraded version of the Type 052C, with up to 96 VLS launchers and 128 YJ-12 anti ship missiles. Construction is expected in 2012. This will be the main surface combatant of the future PLA Navy."

At least one Chinese source of uncertain reliability predicted the Type 052D would have a vertical launch system with a a total of 96 new missile interceptors [16 VLS system with six VLS with 96 VLS cells] , and eight new Eagle 12e anti-ship cruise missiles with a range of about 180-240 km. The ship was projected to have a top speed of 32 knots, and an endurance of 14,000 nautical miles. The ship was projected to have a light displacement of 9500 tons, and a full load displacement of 12,000 tons. The length was reported as 180 meters, a beam of 20 meters, and a draft of 6.5 meters.

Even if these specifications were little more than wishful thinking, they are indicative of an expectation that China would eventually deploy a locally designed surface combatant with a displacement of about 10,000 tons, significantly larger than the 7,000 tons of the Type 052. Whether the Type 052D is this vessel, or whether something larger remains in the wings, remained unclear.

Type 052D "Red Aegis" improvements over Type 052C destroyer

Larger main gun: 130 mm vs. 100 mm
More secure communication: Chinese Link 16 vs. Link 11/TADIL-A equivalent
Larger and more advanced phased array radar: Flat AESA vs. Convex AESA radar
More numerous and versatile VLS (vertical launch system): 64 versatile VLS cells vs. 48 AAW VLS cells
The new destroyers are equipped with two 32-unit vertical launch systems capable of launching HQ-9B air-defense missiles, anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles. The original YJ-62 missile launchers used on the Type 052C do not appear to be present on the new destroyer. It has been speculated that the Type 052D could be equipped with a naval-style version of the DH-10 land-attack cruise missile.

The new-type guided missile destroyer "Kunming" was delivered and commissioned to the Navy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLAN) on 21 March 2014. The "Kunming" with hull number 172, is the new generation of China-made guided missile destroyers. It has strong capacity in air defense and naval warfare.

The layout of the 052D destroyer is similar to that of the earlier 052C, but the superstructure of the 052D slopes inward at a greater angle, providing reduced radar cross-section. Some analysts have said that the overall performance of 052D destroyers is superior to that of Japan's Atago-class destroyers, South Korea's Sejong the Great-class destroyers and the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. But compared with Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, China's type 052D destroyers are inferior in terms of quantity, displacement and ship-based guided missiles. China needs to build larger models, including a 10,000-ton guided-missile destroyer. Furthermore, the country needs an increase in the quantity of guided-missile destroyers, as China will build more aircraft carriers in the future. Since China does not currently have cruisers, larger guided-missile destroyers are needed to play the role of cruisers.

Type 052D, the first of which commissioned in 2014, is a newer design than the DDG-57 Arleigh Burke, but both vessels are very good looking and capable. However, there are characteristics of the Burke IIA that are noteworthy and important, despite aesthetics. The Burke IIA has 96 VLS cells the Type 052D has 64. The Burke IIA carries two helicopters, the Type 052D carries one. The slope on the side panels of the Burke IIA provide better radar dispersion, because they are sloped more, particularly above the main deck, and also with the "raked" mast. The bow Sonar on the Burke IIA is much more powerful than that on the Type 052D. The wider beam on the Burke IIA allows for better handling, particularly in rough sea states. The AEGIS system and cooperative engagement capabilities on the Burke IIA are very well known, understood, and proven. The effectiveness of the new APARs and the combat system on the Type 052D remain unknown.

About 160 meters long and with a beam of 18 meters [versus 157 and 18 meters for the DDG-51], the Type 052D is slightly larger than its predecessor, the Type 052C, and is believed to displace slightly over 6,000-7,000 tons [rather less than the 9,200 ton Arleigh Burke]. The vessel uses the Type 346 Active Phased Array Radar System and a Type 518 L-band long-range radar. The main 100mm gun on the Type 052C, which was reportedly unreliable, has been replaced by a new PJ-38 130mm gun. The vessel also has a helicopter-landing platform [and probably a hangar for two helicopters, as the Type 52C] and the Chinese Type 730 counterpart to the US Close-In Weapon System.

The 130 mm gun was developed by the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of Zhengzhou (Zhengzhou 713 Institute), and produced by by the 2nd Machinery Factory (Baotou,Inner Mongolia). The original design used a single tube dual link ammunition handling and water-cooled systems; the barrel length (with breech) is 70 calibers. Using fully automatic loading gear teh gun has a rate of fire 40 rounds / minute. The range of non-guided shells is about 30 kilometers. The entire gun has a weight (excluding peripherals) greater than 50 tonnes, including the stealth housing. The design of this gun is thought to be based on the proven technologies of the Russian AK-130 130 mm twin-barrel gun, mainly the mechanical design, which is a weak element in Chinese ship-borne guns. The gun electrical control and aiming servo system are dependent on a new localization design.

One of the most moving episodes in the Chinese blockbuster Wolf Warrior 2 is the one in which the captain of a Type 052D guided-missile destroyer shouts "Fire!" to order the launch of supersonic cruise missiles to hit rebel troops in an imaginary African nation holding Chinese hostages. However, this scenario could not have happened in real life because in the Gulf of Aden there have been no Type 052D destroyers-now considered the most capable combat ship in the People's Liberation Army Navy. Instead, the Navy has sent other vessels to the once pirate-plagued waters to protect civilian vessels for nearly 11 years. That changed as the Navy decided to dispatch a Type 052D to take part in its latest escort mission. The CNS Xining, the fifth in the Type 052D class, sailed toward the Gulf of Aden in August 2019.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Weapon Station #1 information for the Type 052D Class (Luyang III-Class) Chinese Destroyer of the Armament:
The Name is PJ-38.
The Type is 30 mm naval gun.
The Caliber is 130 mm.
The Quantity is 1 x PJ-38.
The Design is Designed by the Zhengzhou Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Research Institute (郑州机电工程研究所, also known as the 713th Research Institute of the 7th Academy) and manufactured by Inner Mongolia 2nd Machinery Manufacturing Factory (内蒙第二机械制造厂), the H/PJ-38 130 mm naval gun was developed from reverse engineering of Soviet AK-130 twin 130 mm naval gun, which was carried out by the same two establishments. The general designer of the H/PJ-38, Chen Dingfeng (陈汀峰), was also the general designer of all models of Type 79 100 mm naval gun, all models of Type 210 100 mm naval gun, and the H/PJ26 76 mm naval gun. Chen was recalled from retirement to complete the H/PJ-38 single barrel 130 mm naval gun. When the Soviet AK-130 was first successfully copied by Chinese developers, the Chinese navy was unsatisfied and decided not to let the AK-130 into production, despite all performance parameters being met. Because the AK-130 was judged out-of-date by the Chinese Navy, the H/PJ-38 program was created in 2005. The H/PJ-38 130 mm single barrel naval gun is considered more powerful and more reliable than other smaller caliber naval guns currently in Chinese service, and as with naval guns on most warships, it is installed in front of the VLS..
The Ammunition is The general designer of munitions for the H/PJ-38, Zhou Bingwu (周炳武), entered the business in 1997 and almost lost the index finger of his right hand in November 2007 during an important trial. As early as 1987, Zhou had proposed multiple kinds of precision-guided munitions (PGMs) to be fired by a single caliber gun mount, but due to the limitations of the Chinese technological base and industrial capability, it was not until two decades later when it finally became a reality. Research led to the development of a single barreled 70 caliber, 130 mm system which took more than four years to complete, and the H/PJ-38 went to series production soon after completion. The primary improvement of the H/PJ-38 over the AK-130 is its adaptability: H/PJ-38 can fire both separate loading rounds and semi-fixed rounds, which is crucial in firing gun-launched missiles and PGMs. The H/PJ-38 can also fire a variety of sub-caliber rounds, but more importantly, a variety of PGMs were developed for H/PJ-38 to increase its effectiveness..

Here is Weapon Station #2 information for the Type 052D Class (Luyang III-Class) Chinese Destroyer of the Armament:
The Name is Type 730 CIWS.
The Type is seven-barrelled 30 mm Gatling gun CIWS..
The Caliber is 30 mm.
The Quantity is 2 x Type 730 CIWS Systems.
The Crew is Automated, with human oversight.
The Barrels is 7-barrel (Type 730).
The Rate of Fire is 1,200-4,200 rounds/minute (Type 730)
11,000 rounds/minute (Type 1130).
The Effective Firing Range is 1–1.5 km.
The Maximum Firing Range is 3 km.
The Feed System is Type 730: One ammunition boxes, holding 640 rounds
Type 730B/C, LD-2000: Two ammunition boxes, each holding 500 rounds (total 1000 rounds)

Type 1130: Two ammunition boxes, each holding 640 rounds (total 1280 rounds).
The Main Armament is 1×30 mm H/PJ-12 or H/PJ-11 Gatling gun.
The Guidance System is TR47C J-band radar
OFC-3 electro-optical fire control system.
The Radar is The TR47C radar operates in the same way of AN/APY-1/2 radar on board E-3 Sentry in that the azimuth is scanned mechanically, while the elevation is scanned electronically, incorporating a total of 169 transceivers of phased array technology that enables the radar to pick up the splashes of 30 mm rounds. Like the western CIWS, the information is processed on site, via local computers of the radar and the gun mount, thus providing faster reaction time than the Russian design in which the radar and fire control system are separately located.

The system can track a sea-skimming target with 0.1 square metre radar cross section at 8 km, extended to 15 km if the radar cross section is increased to 2 square metres, and further extended to 20 km if the radar cross section is increased to 10 square metres, though the targets could not be engaged until much closer (3 km) due to the limited range of the gun..
The Fire Control System is The OFC-3 system is modular design that comprises a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can be replaced by a laser designator (for a laser beam-riding SAM), the TV camera can be replaced by a night vision camera, and the IR camera can be replaced by an ImIR, at higher cost. Development to incorporate the dual band IR, night vision camera, and the color TV camera is reportedly in progress.

Type 730 CIWS is an autonomous closed-loop system and thus offers faster reaction time than the Russian AK-630. Type 730 CIWS is fully compatible with Chinese and European combat data systems such as ZKJ-1, ZKJ-4, ZKJ-4A-3, ZKJ-5, ZKJ-6, ZKJ-7, H/ZBJ-1, and Thomson-CSF TAVITAC, and can be directly integrated with these combat data systems without any modification..

Here is Radars information for the Type 052D Class (Luyang III-Class) Chinese Destroyer:
The 1 x Type 346 multi-function phased-array radar is Type 346 radar is a highly digitized, multi-function, dual-band (S and C bands) naval active electronically scanned array (AESA) installed on Type 052C destroyers, Type 052D destroyers, Type 055 destroyers and Type 001A aircraft carriers[1] of the PLAN. The radar is named as the Star of the Sea (Hai-Zhi-Xing, 海之星) by its developer and it is one of the two competitors for PLAN’s SAPARS (Shipborne Active Phased Array Radar System) project/program. Due to its secrecy and lack of information, Type 346 radar has been frequently but erroneously confused with a Chinese fire control radar Type 348, and mistakenly identified as Type 348 by many sources. Furthermore, it is also frequently confused with and misidentified as Sea Lion series C-band phased array radars developed by another design house. Several models in the Type 346 series have been developed. When Star of the Sea was selected as the winner of SAPARS and accepted into Chinese service, it received the Chinese naval designation for the entire radar system as H/LJG-346 or Type 346 for short. The NATO reporting name for Type 346 radar is Dragon Eye..
The 1 x Type 518 L-band air-surveillance radar is The Type 518 radar is a Chinese high performance L band long range shipboard air surveillance radar. The Type 518 radar may be installed in destroyers or heavy tonnage naval vessels to detect long range high altitude aircraft in adverse natural noise and active electronic jamming environments.
