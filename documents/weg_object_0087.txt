This document describes the Kabina 66/5n87 (Back Trap) Russian 3D Long-Range Radar System.

Air defense radar unit of the former Soviet Union

Interesting at this radar unit is the diametral attachment of 2 antenna systems. Every antenna is meant for another elevation angle. Since two equal radar units always turned a location synchronously, four height ranges were felt therefore (like a Stacked- Beam- Antenna).

The Kabina 66 was coupled with several height-finders (2 - 4 height-finders PRV-13 or PRV-17). The frequency is processed with four impulses but only two of these are transmitted. Two radar units work synchronously as a couple but also separate operation is possible. The rotary drive is hydraulically carried out.
The power supply (300 kW / 400 Hz) is carried out of convertor or with diesel engines. A transfer needs 19 railroad plate freight cars.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
