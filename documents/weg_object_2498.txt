This document describes the CS/VN3 Chinese 4x4 Armored Scout Car.

The CS/VN3 Chinese 4x4 Armored Scout Car resembles the French Panhard VBL or Swiss MOWAG Eagle III armored scout cars but is slightly larger. This vehicle was revealed in 2007. It is understood that the development of this light reconnaissance vehicle is now complete. Currently, it is produced in small quantities for the Chinese Army. It is also being proposed for export customers as a light multi-purpose armored personnel carrier. It is worth mentioning that this armored vehicle costs far less than comparable Western or Russian systems.

 The VN3 armored scout car has an all-welded steel hull. It provides protection from small arms fire, artillery shell splinters, as well as some types of mines.

   This armored scout car is fitted with a one-person turret, armed with a 12.7 mm or 14.5 mm heavy machine gun.

   The VN3 has a crew of five, including a commander, gunner, driver, and two scouts. Occupants enter and leave the vehicle through the side or rear doors, or roof hatches. There are some firing ports and associated vision blocks provided for the occupants. The vehicle is powered by a front-mounted diesel engine.

   Alternatively, the VN3 armored scout car could be configured as an armored personnel carrier, with the turret removed. In this case, it has a crew of two and accommodates eight troops. Other variants of this scout car include a larger unidentified 4x4 armored vehicle, fitted with a 30 mm turret-mounted cannon. This vehicle uses a turret similar to that of the ZLC 2000 airborne combat vehicle. Another variant is amphibious and can carry HJ-8 anti-tank missiles.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belarus, China, Laos (People's Democratic Republic).
