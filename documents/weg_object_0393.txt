This document describes the Fateh-110 Iranian Close-Range Ballistic Missile.

Hezbollah and Houthi Proliferation. Prompted by its experience in the war with Iraq in the 1980s, Iran actively pursued a ballistic missile arsenal that had greater precision and accuracy.  As part of this effort, Iran began developing the Fateh-110 in 1995 (Victorious-110; also known as the NP-110).  The Fateh-110 is a solid fueled short range ballistic missile. The missile is also capable of carrying nuclear or biological warheads.  As a road mobile system, the Fateh-110 series can be launched from any location.  Iran developed four variations of the Fateh-110.

Iran successfully tested its first solid-fueled surface-to-surface missile, state-run Tehran radio reported on 31 May 2001. The guided Fateh-110 missile was developed at the government-owned Aerospace Industries, the radio said, adding "Fateh-110, a super-modern surface-to-surface missile, functions with combined solid-fuel, is able to cause great damage and finds targets with accuracy. The missile is classified among Iran's most efficient missiles.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Non-State Actors, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Syria.

Here is Variants information for the Fateh-110 Iranian Close-Range Ballistic Missile:
The The Fateh-110/I is Has a maximum range of 200km (124 miles), and can carry a 650kg payload. It was declared operational in 2002..
The The Fateh-110/II is Has a range of 250km (155 miles), a payload of 450kg. Iran announced the development of this variant in 2004..
The The Fateh-110/III is Was announced in 2010 and designed to have more accuracy and a quicker launch time. It has a range of 300km, can carry a 650kgpayload..
The The Fateh-110/IV is Developed in 2012 and is designed to have precision targeting and has a guidance system. It also has a range of 300km, can carry a 650kg payload..
The Zolfaghar is On September 25, 2016, Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan announced that Iranâ€™s new Zolfaghar ballistic missile, a Fateh-110 variant, has a potential range of 700 km.  The newest member of the Fateh-110 family of solid-fueled short-range ballistic missiles, Iran claims that Zolfaghar is equipped with a a sub-munition warhead.  The Iranian Ministry of Defense released a video allegedly showing the Zolfaghar being fired and successfully hitting a small target.  The authenticity of the video has not been verified..
The Fateh-110 Anti-Ship Variants is In 2014, the IRGC displayed two variants of the Fateh missile it called the Hormuz-1 and Hormuz-2.  The Hormuz-1 is claimed to have anti-radiation capabilities for attacking radar systems, and in 2014, Iranian television broadcast images of commanders watching an attack on a target with radar antennae.  The original claim was that Hormuz-2 was an anti-ship variant, but images of the missile suggested it had a similar radio frequency-transparent ray dome and not a window for an electro-optical infrared seeker, suggesting it is essentially the same as the Hormuz-1.

Another anti-ship variant of the Fateh is the Khalij Fars, which does have the electro-optical seeker required to improve accuracy enough to potentially hit a moving target. Tehran claims that early version Khalij Fars entered service in 2008, but was not officially delivered to the Iranian military until a ceremony in March 2014.  This ceremony featured Fateh missiles painted blue to suggest an anti-ship variant, but Iran put caps on the noses of the missile preventing verification of the EO/IR seekers.  The Department of Defense did assess in the unclassified version of its 2014 report on the military power of Iran that it does possess an anti-ship ballistic missile capability..
