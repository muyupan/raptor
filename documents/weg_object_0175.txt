This document describes the P-270 Moskit (SS-N-22 Sunburn) Russian Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile.

The P-270 Moskit is a Soviet supersonic ramjet-powered anti-ship cruise missile. Its GRAU designation is 3M80, the air-launched variant is the Kh-41 and its NATO reporting name is SS-N-22 Sunburn. The missile system was designed by the Raduga Design Bureau during the 1970s as a follow-up to the P-120 Malakhit (NATO reporting name "SS-N-9 Siren"). The Moskit was originally designed to be ship-launched, but variants have been adapted to be launched from land (modified trucks), underwater (submarines), and air (reportedly the Sukhoi Su-33, a naval variant of the Sukhoi Su-27), as well as on the Lun-class ekranoplan. The missile can carry conventional and nuclear warheads. The exact classification of the missile is unknown, with varying types reported. This uncertainty is due to the secrecy surrounding an active military weapon. The missile has been purchased and exported to the People's Liberation Army Navy (China) and Indian Navy (India).

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Egypt, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Viet Nam.
