This document describes the S-75 Dvina (SA-2 Guideline) Russian Strategic Surface-to-Air Missile System.

The S-75 (Russian: С-75; NATO reporting name SA-2 Guideline) is a Soviet-designed, high-altitude air defense system, built around a surface-to-air missile with command guidance. Following its first deployment in 1957 it became one of the most widely deployed air defense systems in history. 

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Mongolia, Myanmar, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Romania, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zimbabwe.

Here is Variants information for the S-75 Dvina (SA-2 Guideline) Russian Strategic Surface-to-Air Missile System:
The SA-2A (Guideline Mod 0) is This was the initial variant of the SA-2, which was deployed around Moscow, Leningrad and in the Baku region. It was guided by the Fan Song A radar system. It was probably a pre-production version..
The SA-2B (Guideline Mod 1) is This improved version replaced the Mod 0. It is slightly longer than the Guideline Mod 0 and is guided by the Fan Song B radar system..
The SA-2C (Guideline Mod 2) is Developed at the same time as the Guideline-B, this variant is equipped with a modified Fan Song C/D G-band engagement radar. The missile itself has a longer engagement range and can attack targets that are at lower altitudes than earlier versions of the SA-2..
The SA-2D (Guideline Mod 3) is This short-lived variant fired V-750AK missiles and operated with the Fan Song E radar. It was more capable of defeating targets in hostile electronic warfare environments. It was eventually superseded in Soviet service by the Guideline Mod 4..
The SA-2E (Guideline Mod 4) is This variant, also known as the S-75M Volga, used the V-755 missile, which was characterized by a swelled warhead section that could be fitted with a 25 kT nuclear warhead. It was guided by the Fan Song F radar..
The SA-2F (Guideline Mod 5) is This variant, also designated the S-75M3 Volkhov, was developed with some technology derived from the SA-3 Goa ** (see separate record). It utilizes the improved Fan Song E radar, which is much more capable of hitting targets in a heavy ECM environment. This is accomplished by deploying a two-man t eam in a "dog house" on top of the radar. These two crewmembers track targets when the normal automatic tracking system has been jammed..
The S-75 Volga 2A is This version was developed in 1995. Twelve digital assemblies replaced 78 analog assemblies. It fired an upgraded V-755 missile and used a modernized Fan Song F radar. It was primarily intended for export..
The S-75 Volga 2T is Belarusian firm Tetraedr in 2004 began offering the S-75 Volga 2T upgrade kit. This included digital electronics and enhanced radars, launch control and missiles..
The SA-N-2 is This is the naval version of the SA-2. The mount included a twin-arm launcher fed by a large drum magazine. A navalized version of the Fan Song E radar was equipped, along with a High Lune** height finding radar..
The Iraqi modified SA-2 Guideline is Iraq announced in 1989 that it had modified a number of SA-2s with an infrared terminal guidance system that improved the missile's capability against targets in high ECM environments. If the missile lost lock at this stage, the weapon could switch back to radio guidance. Iraq also attempted other modifications.
The CSS-8 is his is a short-range ballistic missile based on the SA-2..
The Sayyad-1 is This is an Iranian reverse-engineered version of the SA-2. It is believed to have entered service in 1998. The design is also influenced by the Chinese HQ-2 and may feature some North Korean technology..
The Sayyad-2 is This is an Iranian upgrade of the Sayyad-1, based on both the SA-2 and the Chinese HQ-2..
The RM-75MVU-1/VU-1 target missiles is his is a low-altitude (RM-75MVU-1) and high-altitude (RM-75VU-1) target missile based on the SA-2 was announced by Russia in mid-2004. The target missiles were to be used to test new surface-to-air missile systems being designed by the Almaz research and production association..
The Qaher-1/-M2 is These variants based on the S-75/SA-2 have been used by Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Qaher-1 was revealed in 2015 with a range of 186.4 mi (300 km) and warhead weighing 440.9 lb (200 kg)..
