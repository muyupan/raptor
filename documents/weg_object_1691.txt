This document describes the Diponegoro Class (SIGMA 9113 Class) Indonesian Corvette.

Indonesia's SIGMA-class (or DIPONEGORO-class) corvettes are based on a Dutch modular design to produce three different sizes of naval patrol vessels. SIGMA is an acronym for "ship integrated geometrical modularity approach." The ships are based on a common design defined by a set of geometric parameters, which are applied throughout the entire range of the class and which provide a repetition of identical units, both in the dimensions of the ship's spaces and in the layout. The corvettes for Indonesia cost an estimated $212 million for the first two and $339 million for the second two

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Indonesia.
