This document describes the Pulau Rengat Class Indonesian Minehunter.

The Indonesian Navy ordered two minehunters based on the Alkmaar class from the Netherlands on 29 March 1985. Known as the Pulau Rengat class, the vessels have a standard displacement of 520 tonnes (510 long tons) and 594 tonnes (585 long tons) at full load. They have a different layout than European Tripartite minehunters due to their mission profile being larger, with the vessels intended to operate as minehunters, minesweepers and patrol ships. For conventional missions the vessels are powered by two MTU 12V 396 TCD91 diesel engines turning one shaft with a LIPS controllable pitch propeller rated at 1,400 kilowatts (1,900 hp) for a maximum speed of 15.5 knots (28.7 km/h; 17.8 mph). The minehunters are also equipped with two 56-kilowatt (75 hp) bow thrusters and two retractable Schottel 89-kilowatt (120 hp) rudder propellers energised by three Turbomecca gas turbine generators. Using the auxiliary propulsion system, the Pulau Rengat class has a maximum speed of 7 knots (13 km/h; 8.1 mph). They have a range of 3,500 nautical miles (6,500 km; 4,000 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph).

The Pulau Rengat class mounts two Rheinmetall 20 mm guns and have the capability to have Matra Simbad surface-to-air missile launchers installed or a third 20 mm gun. The Pulau Rengats are equipped with OD3 Oropesa mechanical sweep gear, Fiskar F82 magnetic sweep and SA Marine AS 203 acoustic sweep gear for minesweeping duties. They also have an Ibis V minehunting system and two PAP 104 Mk 4 mine disposal systems along with the Signaal SEWACCO-RI combat data system, Racal Decca AC 1229C radar and Thomson Sintra TSM 2022 sonar. 

Ships in class (Indonesia)
Initially, Indonesia intended to order ten hulls. However, funds were lacking and only two were built. The first was ordered on 29 March 1985 and the second on 30 August 1985. The two ships were initially part of the Royal Netherlands Navy production and were given Dutch names. They were renamed upon sale to Indonesia.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Indonesia.
