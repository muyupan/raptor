This document describes the C8 Canadian 5.56mm Carbine Rifle.

The Canadian C8 carbine is the shortened carbine version of the 5.56x45mm C7 series assault rifle. The C8 is essentially a US M-4.. It is a select-fire rifle having three modes of safe, semi-automatic and full-automatic. Cartridges are magazine-fed from the bottom. The C8 is capable of mounting an under barrel 40-mm grenade launcher as well as a bayonet. The C8 is manufactured by Colt Canada located in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Canada, Denmark, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Here is Variants information for the C8 Canadian 5.56mm Carbine Rifle:
The C8A3 is The C8A3 replaced the C8 FTHB (Flat Top Heavy Barrel). This version has got ambidextrous controls..
The C8A2 is The C8A2 carbine is very similar to the C8, but having a cold-hammer forged heavy 368-millimetre (14.5 in) barrel (as opposed to the 14.5-inch pencil-profile barrel) and a flat-top upper receiver..
The C8A1 is The improved C8A1 (Diemaco C8FT) is essentially a C8 carbine with a C7A1 flat-top upper receiver; the carbine having a 368-millimetre (14.5 in) barrel versus the 508-millimetre (20.0 in) barrel typically seen on the C7.[6] The overall layout of the weapon remains essentially unchanged except for the upper receiver and the general inclusion of the C79 sight. C8A1s have also been more commonly seen with the detachable carry handle with A1 sights developed by Diemaco for both the C7FT and the C8FT. The C8A1 was never officially adopted by the Canadian Forces and was only used in Afghanistan for the ability to use the C79 optical sights..
The C8FTHB is Concerns that Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry had with the C8 led to the creation of the C8FTHB. The C8FTHB (Flat Top Heavy Barrel) features numerous improvements over the C8, including a heavy profile cold hammer-forged M4 profile barrel featuring a grenade launcher cut out for mounting of the Canadian Forces M203A1 and bayonet and Elcan C79 Optical Sight. 

Some of the earlier C8FTHB carbines used old refurbished C8 receivers. "FTHB" was stamped next to the C8 markings on the lower receivers. Colt Canada later manufactured new lower receivers with C8FTHB markings. Later, C8FTHB carbines that were upgraded to the C8A3 had "A3" stamped next to the markings, giving "C8FTHBA3" markings. Only 400 C8FTHBs were upgraded to C8FTHBA3s before Colt Canada started simply marking new receivers "C8A3"..
The C8SFW is The Special Forces Weapon (SFW) features a longer, 399-millimetre (15.7 in) barrel of a heavier profile than the C8A1. It is designed to provide a fire support capability in carbine form. A sleeve, called the simon sleeve, is slipped over the end of the barrel and is retained by the compensator and its crush washer. It is used to mount bayonets and M203A1s. The front sight base is strengthened for mounting of the Heckler & Koch AG-C/EGLM grenade launcher. The United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF) adopted the C8 SFW, under the designation "L119A1."[citation needed] In 2014, UKSF upgraded to the "L119A2", which features the Integrated Upper Receiver (IUR). This version of the C8 is also in service with the Norwegian Special Operations Forces.
