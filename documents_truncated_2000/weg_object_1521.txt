This document describes the Zhotvi Vodi-Class (Project 266M Class) Ukrainian Coastal Minesweeper.

Zhotvi Vodi-Class (Former Russian Natya-I-Class) is a Ukrainian designation after transfer from the Russian Navy in 1997. Only two ships were transferred to Ukraine. The Natya-I class ships have aluminum-steel alloy, long-forecastle hulls with a short, raked bow with sheer extending to abaft the forward 30-mm twin gun mount. The superstructure is set well forward and has a tall, quadruped mast stepped abaft the bridge. The single, capped stack rises out of the main deck above the superstructure. The Cheraski (U-311) was placed in commission upon transfer, but Zhotvi Vodi (U-310) was not commissioned until mid-2000. Both are equipped to serve as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) escorts, with the RBU-1200 launchers also used for detonating mines.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Ukraine.
