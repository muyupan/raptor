This document describes the DZ-9001 Chinese Mobile Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) System.

The Chinese DZ-9001 is a vehicle-mounted ELINT System developed by Jiangnan Electronic & Communications Research Institute (JECOR, 36th Institute) of China Electronics Technology Group) located in Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province. Development of the system began in 1984 with fielding to the PLA in the late 1980s.

The DZ-9001 uses a low-frequency system and a high-frequency system and power supply to detect, intercept, analyze, identify, and record enemy radar radiation. The high (8-18 GHz) and low (1-8 GHz) frequency systems can be operated independently or together.

Once the enemy emitter signal profile (technical parameters and operation modes) have been collected and analyzed, operations personnel can begin the planning of defensive and offensive countermeasures to degrade or defeat the respective enemy communications and non-communication emitter.
