This document describes the 2A36 Giatsint-B Russian 152mm Towed Gun.

This is the towed variant of the 2S5. The most distinguishing feature of the 2A36 is its lower carriage. The large system weight required the use of tandem “walking-beam” axles and four wheels to provide mobility. A hydraulically powered firing pedestal is mounted on the front of the lower carriage and serves as part of the travel lock (similar to the D-20). Although the trails do not have the folding summer spades of the D-20, they do have two large spades similar to those found on the M-46/M-47. The weight of the 2A36 normally requires it to be towed by a heavy truck (like the KRAZ-255B). The KRAZ-255B is equipped with a special winch used to lift the trails in order to attach the gun’s lunette to the towing pintle.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, CFE Treaty, Finland, Georgia, Iraq, Lebanon, Moldova, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.
