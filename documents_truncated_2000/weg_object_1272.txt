This document describes the SAM-18 (SA-18 Grouse) Iranian Man-Portable Air-Defense Missile System (MANPADS).

The SA-18 Grouse or Igla or 9K38 is a Russian made man-portable infrared homing surface-to-air missile defence system (SAM/MANPAD). This is a third-generation, man-portable, surface-to-air missile system and it is given the Russian industrial index number 9K38, for the complete system. The SA-18 Grouse with its 9M39 missile was accepted into service in the Soviet Army in 1983.

The full-capability 9K38 Igla with its 9M39 missile was finally accepted into service in the Soviet Army in 1983. The main improvements over the Igla-1 included much improved resistance against flares and jamming, a more sensitive seeker, expanding forward-hemisphere engagement capability to include straight-approaching fighters (all-aspect capability) under favourable circumstances, a slightly longer range, a higher-impulse, shorter-burning rocket with higher peak velocity (but approximately same time of flight to maximum range).



The naval variant of 9K38 Igla has the NATO reporting name SA-N-10 Grouse.

The Igla–1M missile consists of a Ground Power Supply Source (GPSS), Launching Tube, Launching Mechanism & Missile (9M 313–1).

There is also a two-barrel 9K38 missile launcher called Djigit.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of).
