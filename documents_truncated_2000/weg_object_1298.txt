This document describes the UAZ-469 Russian 4x4 Light Utility Vehicle.

The UAZ-469 is an off-road military light utility vehicle manufactured by UAZ. It was used by Soviet and other Warsaw Pact armed forces, as well as paramilitary units in Eastern Bloc countries. In the Soviet Union, it also saw widespread service in state organizations that needed a robust and durable off-road vehicle. Standard military versions included seating for seven personnel.

Developed from the GAZ-69, UAZ-471, and UAZ-460, the UAZ-469 was introduced in 1971 to replace the GAZ-69. It was powered by the same 75 hp (56 kW; 76 PS) 2,445 cc (149.2 cu in) UMZ 452MI inline-four engine as the UAZ-452 and was able to run on gasoline with an octane rating as low as 72 (although 76 was preferred). The UAZ-469 presented two great advantages: it was able to drive in virtually any terrain and it was very easy to repair. The vehicle was originally not available for purchase by the public, but many were sold as surplus to private owners.
