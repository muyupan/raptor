This document describes the M1985 North Korea Light Amphibious Battle Tank.

The M1985 is a North Korean light tank that is based on the designs of the Russian PT-76 and the Chinese Type 63 amphibious light tanks.

The M1985 hull is similar in size and appearance to the Type 63 but has a turret resembling the PT-76. The hull is probably based on the same chassis as the VTT-323 armored personnel carrier (see separate record).

The North Korean turret does differ in several aspects. On the forward edge of the turret, in line with the main gun, is an anti-tank guided missile rail. The commander's hatch has a semi-circle shape, unlike the Soviet-era oval hatch, and is located on the top left side of the turret. The hatch opens to the front, rather than to the rear as in the PT-76.

The hull is all-welded steel. The driver sits to the front left. Ammunition is stored to his right. The engine and transmission are in the rear.

The M1985 probably does not have any horizontal or vertical gun stabilizers; that, however, is unconfirmed. It may come equipped with a night-vision system and nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) warfare protection.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).
