This document describes the Striker 3000 American 6x6 Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Vehicle.

The Oshkosh Striker is a specialized aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) vehicle built by Oshkosh Corporation at the Pierce Mfg. facilities Appleton, Wisconsin. There are three models of the Striker: 1500, 3000, 4500. All models are available with a snozzle capable of piercing an aircraft fuselage to dispense fire retardant material within a cabin or cargo area.

On April 17, 2015 Oshkosh announced they will debut a new twin engine Striker 8 X 8 at Interschutz 2015.

The Striker 3000, a.k.a. Striker 6x6, is the 3 axle model. It features:

*3,000-US-gallon (11,000 l) water tank
*420-US-gallon (1,600 l) foam tank
*500 pounds (230 kg) of dry chemical
*460 pounds (210 kg) of Halotron 1

Innovative Fire Suppression
CROSSLAYS –With the optional twin crosslays on the Striker, you can have up to 600 feet (183 m) of 1¾” (45mm) hose at your disposal– accessible from either side of the vehicle.

LARGE PUMP OPTION – Larger planes mean greater challenges. Oshkosh offers an optional 2650 gpm (10,000 lpm) pump to provide all of the water and/or foam you will need to meet these challenges.

BRONZE PUMP – Long ago, you asked for a corrosion resistant pump body. In response, Oshkosh made it available on the Striker. That tradition of excellence carries forward on the Striker.

ELECTRONIC FOAM PROPORTIONING –With this all new pressure governed system, the water pump knows what is required to meet your fire suppression needs and runs the engine just enough to meet those needs. This allows your vehicle to use less fuel – reducing overall wear and tear – yet still perform as only a Striker can.

ADVANCED FIRE SUPPRESSION TECHNOLOGIES – Firefighters face new challenges every day. The Striker is designed to be ready for the latest technologies still under development, including ultra high-pressure water, compressed air foam systems (CAFS), and clean agent delivery systems.

Unmatched Chassis Performance
The Striker provides fast acceleration – a full second faster to 50 miles per hour – and delivers increased fuel economy from the 697 hp Tier 4i/Euro 5 emission compliant engine. It also delivers a lower center of gravity, tighter turning radius and, with the help of TAK-4® all-wheel independent suspension, the Striker delivers a confident and controlled ride.

LIGHTER WEIGHT – The Striker is designed to be lighter by 5%. What does that mean to you? Faster acceleration, for one thing. Also, better stopping distance. Best of all, it still possesses that quality and toughness that Oshkosh is known for.

Advanced Safety Systems
Safety is built into all aspects of the Striker – from the cab design to the certified testing for static side slope stability and structural integrity.

IMPROVED BRAKE TORQUE – With our new disc brake option we have improved brake torque by 11%. So, when you need to stop, you stop.

NITROGEN BOTTLE STORAGE – The Striker provides excellent access to the vertically stored nitrogen bottles for easy and safe removal and reloading.

Unsurpassed Reliability And Durability
Oshkosh vehicles are renowned for their reliability and durability–and the Striker continues the tradition.

ACCESS – Service technicians told us that easy access to the engine compartment is critical. Open up the rear door on the Striker and you will find an exclusive walk-in service port with easy access. And, if necessary, the entire powertrain can be removed for maintenance – without involving the water tank.

FILTER AND FLUID CHECK –The Striker has a single, easy to access area with all filters AND fluid checks including: engine oil, transmission fluid, and power divider fluid. One location means you can know, with confidence and in no time at all, that your Striker is ready for action.

SERVICEABILITY – Well thought out and well designed electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic line routing means unsurpassed access to wires, oil, and air lines for faster diagnostic time.

24/7/365 SERVICE – Our worldwide service dealer network is ready when you need us.

Smart Design
VISIBILITY – With 84 square feet of glass and a 238-degree horizontal viewing radius at eye level, the Striker offers unparalleled visibility. Utilizing the Oshkosh center steer driving position, you will feel like you are in the cockpit of a fighter jet.

FORWARD VISIBILITY - We have improved your ability see the ground below you. NFPA requires you to see 20 feet out from the front bumper. The Striker allows you to see 12.3 feet. You will have to sit in this cab to believe it.

ERGONOMICS – Completely redesigned cab instrumentation is logical and purpose built. Through extensive ergonomic research with users around the world, we observed how you used the vehicle and designed each control, switch, and instrument to be intuitive and ready when you are.

LOGICAL CONTROLS – Color-coded controls to clearly identify what function and/or what agent you are utilizing, allows you, quickly and with confidence, focus on the task at hand.

IMPROVED STORAGE – You said you needed more dedicated storage. We listened. With over 63 cubic feet (1.8 m3), the Striker has plenty of room for everything you could possibly need.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: United States of America.
