This document describes the JRTC VISMOD: T-80B Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The T-80B is a front-line combat vehicle which combines operational mobility and tactical offensives and defensive capabilities.

This variant features the 9K112 Kobra missile system. It also has improvements to the computerized fire-control system, including a laser rangefinder.
The T-80B main battle tank is a further development of the original T-80, which was produced only in small numbers. The T-80B is the first variant produced in quantity. Small scale production of this tank commenced in 1978. At least 5,391 T-80B and improved T-80BV tanks were produced. Due to expensive maintenance the Russian Army planned to retire all T-80 series tanks by 2015. However in 2017 upgraded versions of this tank was publicly revealed. Protection of the T-80B was improved comparing with the T-80. The tank is fitted with a composite armor at the front of the hull and turret. Its hull provides protection equivalent to 570-820mm of Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) against armor piercing rounds, depending on the projectile type. Turret provides protection equivalent to 420-760mm or RHA. This tank is fitted with NBC protection and fire suppression systems. The original T-80B tanks lacked explosive reactive armor, which was fitted to improved models and were painted olive drab.  
Fording depths (m): 12.0 with BROD-M system.  The night sight cannot be used to launch the ATGM.  The day sight can be used at night for launching ATGMs if the target is illuminated. A variety of thermal sights are available. They include the Russian Agava-2, French Sagem-produced Alis and Namut sight from Peleng. There are thermal sights available for installation, which permit night launch of ATGMs. The 12.7mm MG NSVT has both remote electronically operated sight PZU-5 and gun-mounted K10-t reflex sight. The more recent BK-27 HEAT round offers a triple-shaped charge warhead and increased penetration against conventional armor and ERA. The BK-29 round, with a hard penetrator in the nose is designed for use against reactive armor, and as an MP round, has fragmentation effects. If the BK-29 HEAT-MP is used, it may substitute for FRAG-HE (as with NATO countries) or complement FRAG-HE-he. With three round (APFSDS-T, HEAT-MP, ATGMs) in the auto loader versus four, more antitank rounds would be available for the higher rate of fire. The ATGM may be launched while moving slowly. The AT-8 can be auto-loaded with the two halves mated during ramming; but the stub charge is manually loaded. 
The GTA-18A auxiliary power unit is used when the engine is off
