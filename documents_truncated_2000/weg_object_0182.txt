This document describes the 1L13-3 Nebo SV (Box Spring) Russian Mobile 2D Early Warning Radar.

The 1L13-3 Nebo radar (NATO name: BOX SPRING) is a mobile, 2-D early warning radar operating in
the A/B Band. The 1L13-3 Nebo radar ECCM features include pulse to pulse frequency agility. It is designed to reject chaff automatically. The 1L13-3 Nebo radar ECCM features include pulse to pulse frequency agility. It is designed to reject
chaff automatically.


 Capable of being used as part of a radar system to provide a valuable early warning capability
against low observable aircraft. As part of an IADS system, the 1L13 Nebo would be used to cue the high-power
aperture X-band systems to a small acquisition box in which the VLO aircraft can be found.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
