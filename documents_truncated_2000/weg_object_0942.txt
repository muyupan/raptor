This document describes the HZ-5 Chinese Reconnaissance Aircraft.

HZ-5
This was a photographic reconnaissance aircraft retrofitted from a H-5 prototype aircraft. Its design was started in December 1970 and was certificated in 1977. The main modifications were the addition of 2 large medium-high altitude day and night, aerial cameras inside the fuselage bomb bay and wing integral fuel tanks. Compared with the prototype aircraft its range was increased by 47 per cent, combat radius by 50 per cent and endurance by 1 hour and 23 minutes. The success of the HZ-5 filled a gap in the field of short / medium reconnaissance aircraft.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).

Here is Variants information for the HZ-5 Chinese Reconnaissance Aircraft:
The Il-28 Beagle is This was the original Soviet light bomber from which the H-5 is derived. See separate database entry..
The H-5 is This is the basic bomber in a three-seat configuration..
The HD-5 electronic warfare aircraft is This variant was designed for electronic warfare missions. The twin 23-mm cannon turret was removed to make room for the electronic warfare/electronic countermeasures suite. The EW/ECM suite, which reportedly utilized only analog technology, could intercept, identify and jam hostile land-based or shipborne radar emitters. The HD-5 usually operated in groups of three to cover all frequency spectrums. Despite its aging technology, the powerful jammer onboard the aircraft was said to be very effective. The HD-5 was replaced by a more capable EW/electronic intelligence platform based on the Y-8 airframe..
The HJ-5 Mascot is This was a two-seat trainer version. First flight occurred in December 1970, and it entered service in 1972. The type was retired in 1986..
The HZ-5 is This was a three-seat reconnaissance version..
