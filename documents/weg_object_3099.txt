This document describes the PT-91 Twardy Polish Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The PT-91 Twardy (hard) is an improved variant of the Soviet T-72 main battle tank. The PT-91 was developed in Poland in the early 1990s. Production of the PT-91 Twardy tanks for the Polish Army were completed in 2002.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Poland.

Here is Variants information for the PT-91 Twardy Polish Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The PT-91 Twardy is Production variant for Polish Army, extensively modernized development of T-72M1..
The PT-91A Twardy is Development variant with PZL-Wola S-1000 1,000 hp engine with mechanic transmission and number of other minor changes. Used for trials and as a demonstrator on military exhibitions..
The PT-91Z Hardy is (Z for Zmodernizowany – literally Modernized) Further development with SAGEM Savan-15 fire control system; according to live fire tests Savan-15 has an only minor advantage in accuracy over Drawa..
The PT-91M Pendekar is (M for Malaysia) — production export variant for Malaysia with Sagem Savan-15 fire control system, a new 1,000 hp powerpack with Renk automatic transmission bringing its top speed to 70 km/h. Its main gun have been changed to a ZTS 2A46MS 125 mm gun, a 7.62 mm FN MAG coaxial machine gun and a 12.7 mm FN Browning M2 HB AA machine gun..
The PT-91E/Ex is (E for Export) – renamed prototypes of PT-91M used as demonstrators of the export variant shown at military exhibitions. PT-91E is a first prototype initially named SP1 (it is the same vehicle as was shown on military parade in Kuala Lumpur in 2005), PT-91Ex is a second prototype named SP2.[.
The PT-91P is (P for Peru) – Demonstrator for SITDEF Peru'2009 military exhibition. A cheaper alternative to PT-91Ex. This variant is equipped with newest PCO Drawa-TG fire control system with a thermal sight and modern communication system (Radmor RRC9310 radio, WB Electronics Fonet-IP communication system and Teldat battlefield management system)..

The PT-16 is Further development introduced in 2016. Upgrades include improved armor, armament, and mobility. The hull armor and cast turret have been upgraded with add-on composite armor equivalent to up to 1000mm RHA (rolled homogenous armor), supplied by Germany..
The PT-17 is The main goals of the PT-17 tank were to increase firepower and fire maneuverability, increase mobility and survivability on the battlefield, improve crew comfort and increase mission duration..
The PT-91M2 is Although PT-91M2's PT-91M2 modernization objectives are the same as PT-17, the range of PT-91M2 varies considerably. The S-12U engine is powered by an 850-horsepower engine with the enhanced mechanical transmission (Cx version)..

The Autoloader is Yes,  Like the earlier domestic-use-only T-64, the T-72 is equipped with an automatic loading system, eliminating the need for a dedicated crewmember, decreasing the size and weight of the tank.

However, the autoloader is of a noticeably different design. Both the T-64 and T-72 carry their two-section 125 mm ammunition (shell and full propellant charge, or missile and reduced propellant charge) in separate loading trays positioned on top of each other; but firstly, in T-64, 28 of these were arranged vertically as a ring under the turret ring proper, and were rotated to put the correct tray into position under the hoist system in the turret rear. This had the disadvantage of cutting the turret off from the rest of the tank, most notably, the driver. Accessing the hull required partial removal of the trays. The T-72 uses a design that has lower width requirements and does not isolate the turret compartment: the trays are arranged in a circle at the very bottom of the fighting compartment; the trade-off is the reduction of the number of trays to 22. The second difference is that in the T-64 the trays were hinged together and were flipped open as they were brought into position, allowing both the shell/missile and propellant charge to be rammed into the breech in one motion; in the T-72 the tray is brought to the breech as-is, with the shell in the lower slot and the charge in the upper one, and the mechanical rammer sequentially loads each of them, resulting in a longer reloading cycle..
