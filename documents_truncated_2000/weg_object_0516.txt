This document describes the 2B16 (Nona-K) Russian 120mm Towed Gun.

2B16 Nona-K is a 120mm towed gun based on the 120mm Nona gun which also served as the basis for the 2S9 Nona-S and 2S23 Nona-SVK self-propelled guns. Nona-K combines the capabilities of a gun, a mortar, and a howitzer into a single weapon system that can effectively engage troops, fortifications, and armored vehicles. To do so, this artillery system is capable of firing HE-fragmentation, shaped-charge Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAPs), 120mm HE-fragmentation, illuminating, smoke, and incendiary mortar rounds including those designed for NATO's 120mm mortars.

The Russian Army has deployed Nona-K gun systems within motorized infantry battalions. Its effectiveness has been deemed similar to standard 152/155mm HE-fragmentation howitzer ammunition.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, CFE Treaty, Russian Federation, Ukraine.
