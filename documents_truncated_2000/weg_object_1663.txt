This document describes the R-934B Russian VHF Air Communication Automated Jamming Station.

R-934B automated jamming station is intended for jamming of VHF air communication means, air guidance tactical systems and also for jamming of ground fixed and mobile communication lines, cellular and trunk networks which operate at fixed frequencies as well as in program operating frequency change (POFC) mode and short telecode data messages transfer.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
