This document describes the TDK-038 Chinese HF Communication DF/Locating System.

The Chinese TDK-038 is a direction finder designed to DF ground-wave, skywave, and near-vertical-incident-skywave (NVIS) HF signals. The system consists of a master and three slave stations. The TDK-038 is capable of automatically locate a target based on the individual DFs provided by the four stations.

The TDK-038 has two sets of antennas. The Adcock array of ground-mounted dipole antennas is used for HF groundwave and skywave interception. An array of crossed-loop antennas is used for NVIS signals. 

The DF accuracy is 2 degrees with an average DF time of 2 seconds. But, the automatic DF and location require 17 seconds.

The system is designed and marketed by China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation (CEIEC). The system was first marketed at IDEX 97.
