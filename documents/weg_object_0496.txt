This document describes the SR-5 Chinese 220mm Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL).

The SR5 is a Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) designed and manufactured in China by the Company NORINCO (China North Industries Corporation). It is a universal launching platform adopting such technologies as canister launching, automatic loading, and common-frame rocket launching. Featuring intensive and accurate firepower, a high level of automation, rapid reaction, and excellent maneuverability, the weapon can realize common-frame launching of 122mm and 220mm guided/unguided rockets to achieve a highly efficient combination of surface suppression and precision strikes. The SR-5 GMLRS was unveiled for the first time to the public with a scale model shown at the Eurosatory defense exhibition in June 2012. The vehicle is now in service in the Chinese army since 2013. Venezuela has ordered a total of 18 SR5 in 2012 and 6 vehicles were delivered in 2014 to Venezuelan Armed Forces.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).
