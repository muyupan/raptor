This document describes the M113A3 American Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The A3 generation of the M113 family of vehicles is a major, comprehensive upgrade for the entire range of M113 variants. The intent of this upgrade was to increase the overall performance of the US Army's M113 fleet, which was the workhorse of its armored forces in the 1980s (over 20 000 M113s and their variants were in US service then).

   While previous M113 models were considered to have adequate firepower for an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), their protection was considered lacking, and their mobility attributes outdated. With 209 hp and a top speed of 64 km/h, the earlier M113A2 would lag behind the 72 km/h M1 Abrams MBT and M2 Bradley IFV. Fully replacing the M113 family of vehicles with Bradley variants had already proven technically, logistically, and fiscally impossible, which necessitated upgrading the M113s instead of replacing them.

   The decision to proceed with this upgrade was made in 1984. Collectively known as the RISE upgrade (Reliability Improvements for Selected Equipment), the vehicle that would become the M113A3 was planned to be fitted with spall liners, a more powerful engine, and transmission, new controls in the driver's station, external fuel cells, shock-absorbent seats, new brakes, and provisions for appliqué armor. Starting in 1987, all new-built M113s were made to 'A3 standard, and all upgrades have been to 'A3 since 1989.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Canada, Iraq, Thailand, United States of America.
