This document describes the SA-20C (S-300PMU-2) Iranian-Long Range Air Defense Missile System.

The SA-20C is an exported version of the S-300PMU-2


The S-300PMU-2 or SA-20B Favorit air defense missile system was developed especially for export. It evolved from the S-300PM-2, which was developed for the Russian Armed Forces. The S-300PMU-2 has the highest capabilities in the S-300P family. It was introduced in 1997. As of 2016, this system is 19 years old. The S-300PMU-2 is referred in the West as SA-20B Gargoyle. It uses a 30N6E1 (Tomb Stone) radar. This radar has a range of 300 km, can detect 100 targets, track and engage 36 of them and guide 72 missiles. It is worth noting that earlier radars of the S-300 family could simultaneously engage only 6 targets and guide 12 missiles.

The S-300PMU-2 Favourite (DoD designation SA-20B), introduced in 1997 (presented ready 1996), is an upgrade to the S-300PMU-1 with range-extended once again to 195 km (121 mi) with the introduction of the 48N6E2 missile. This system is apparently capable of not just short-range ballistic missiles, but now also medium-range ballistic missiles. It uses the 83M6E2 command and control system, consisting of the 54K6E2 command post vehicle and the 64N6E2 surveillance/detection radar. It employs the 30N6E2 fire control/illumination and guidance radar. Like the S-300PMU-1, 12 TELs can be controlled, with any mix of 5P85SE2 self-propelled and 5P85TE2 trailer launchers. Optionally it can make use of the 96L6E all altitude detection radar and 76N6 low altitude detection radar. A version titled HQ-15 is currently in Chinese service.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of).
