This document describes the K21-105 South Korean Amphibious Light Tank.

The K21-105 is a new light tank. It was jointly developed by CMI Defense of Belgium and Doosan DST of South Korea. In 2014, CMI Defense and Doosan DST publicly revealed the K21-105, a light tank version of the K21 chassis fitted with a CMI Defense CT-CV 105HP turret. Referred to as a medium tank by its developers, the vehicle weighs around 25 tons with a 3-man crew and is cheaper to produce and maintain, and has better mobility than actual tanks. The vehicle's main role is direct fire support for infantry against armored and soft-skinned vehicles, buildings, and fortifications. The main armament is a 105 mm rifled low-recoil gun that fires standard NATO and newly developed smart ammunition with a max direct fire range of 4 km (2.5 mi); although the gun would not be effective against modern main battle tanks, it can defeat older tanks that North Korea still has in widespread service.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: South Korea (Republic of Korea).
