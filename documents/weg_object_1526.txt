This document describes the Combattante lla Class Greek Fast Attack Craft.

The La Combattante IIa fast attack craft is a class of fast attack craft originally built for the German Navy as Type 148 Tiger-class fast attack craft. They were later transferred to the Hellenic Navy and the class was renamed Combattante IIa, as with similar French made ships. All the ships were under mid-life updates in 1980s. Two vessels in the class, P-74 and P-75, were fitted with RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles and a new ESM was fitted after transfer.

A version called the Beir Grassa class, of which 10 were built and 8 were operational as of 1995, were used by the Libyan Navy. One had been sunk and another disabled during a 1986 confrontation with US forces.

Iran ordered 12 ships of the same class (known in Iran as Kaman class), nine of which were delivered in 1977 and 1978, and three of which were delayed until 1981 as a result of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Iranian fast attack craft Paykan was sunk during Operation Morvarid in 1980, while Joshan was sunk by USS Simpson during Operation Praying Mantis in 1988. These ships are not to be confused with the new Joshan and Paykan, which were named in their memories. Iran built a heavily upgraded version of this class called the Sina class. As of 2012 Iran has built 4 Sina-class vessels and is building 5 more of this class.

French-built. US-supplied Harpoon missiles have been expended, and replaced by Iranian made, medium range "Noor", anti-ship cruise missiles. Paykan was sunk during Operation Morvarid by the Iraqi Navy, in 1980, while Joshan was sunk by the American Navy, during Operation Praying Mantis, in 1988. These ships must not be confused with the new Joshan and Paykan, which are part of the Iranian Navy fleet of warships serving in the Caspian Sea.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Greece.
