This document describes the Karrar Iranian Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The Karrar (striker) is a new Iranian main battle tank. It is a significantly upgraded version of the Iranian T-72S tank. A number of these tanks were supplied to Iran from Soviet Union. Currently Iran operates around 480 T-72S and even older T-72M1 tanks that could be upgraded to new standard. Footage on the Karrar was released in 2016. The tank itself was first publicly revealed in 2017. The upgraded tank is fitted with new turret, new add-on armor, new observation and aiming systems, new fire control system, and has a number of other upgrades. All of these upgrades significantly improved combat capabilities of the ageing T-72 series tanks in the key areas of protection, firepower and, possibly, mobility. As of 2017 production of the Karrar is underway. However it is unclear if a pre-production or full-scale production batch is being built.

The main armament of the Karrar consists of a 125 mm smoothbore gun fitted with a fume extractor and a thermal sleeve. A remotely operated weapon station armed with a 12.7 mm machine gun is mounted on the roof of the turret. The main gun is able to fire anti-tank laser-guided missiles. An autoloader is also installed, removing the need of a loader.

The Karrar is supposedly fitted with latest generation of composite armor, with explosive reactive armor (ERA) panels mounted on the front of the hull and turret. There is also armour plates on the sides and slat armour at the rear of the hull and turret.

External fuel tanks can be attached to the rear in order to extend its range

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of).

Here is Variants information for the Karrar Iranian Main Battle Tank (MBT):
The T-72A is Second Russian main variant of the T-72..
The T-72B1 is In 1986, a limited production variant without an ATGM launch capability. Some do not have ERA..
The T-72BK is The Commander's variant with additional radios..
The T-72BM is Russian T-72B upgrade with 2nd gen ERA. The system is fielded, available for export, and upgraded. Tier 2 and some Tier 3 tanks can challenge US forces under favorable conditions when using modern ammunition and employed by well-trained units with sound tactics. A variety of upgrades are available for the T-72B. They include protection upgrades, such as improved ERA, APS, defensive aids suites with IR jammers, plate armor, welded turret, and grill armor around tracks and grill. Mobility upgrades include a new power train, improved steering, improved mine plows and rollers, and electronic mine spoofing system. Fire control system upgrades include new sights, gun, ammunition, and improved stabilization. With the expanding number of upgrades offered by former Warsaw Pact, Asian, Israeli, and other firms, most T-72-type tanks have some level of upgrade from the basic T-72 MBT. The more affordable upgrade approach for most countries is to execute specific upgrades during maintenance work. But this approach may result in only partially modernized tanks at any one point in the life of the vehicle, and which are not as modern as more recent competitors. An alternative is to produce modernized tanks in small numbers, resulting in high per-unit production costs..
The T-72BU is Upgrade variant with the fire control system from the T-80U as well as well as a variety of other changes..
The T-72BU renamed T-90 is With the limited market for new tanks, the world tank industry has developed upgrades and whole vehicle upgrade packages to tap into the market. Older T-72 tanks can be brought up to the T-72B standard. Some approach the T-90 standard. Most T-72-type tanks fielded reflect some level of upgrade. Upgrade options are expanding from former Warsaw Pact, Asian, Israeli, and other international firms..
The T-72S / Shilden is Russian export T-72A upgraded to the T-72B standard. Although visually similar to T-72B, it has slightly less chassis and turret protection. Former Warsaw Pact countries such as Slovakia and Middle Eastern countries like Iran have upgraded their tanks to the T-72S standard..
The M-84AB1 is Yugoslav upgrade to the M-84, bringing it close to the T-90, and the latest T-72B improved tanks..
The M-95 Degman is Croatian M-84 upgrade with box composite armor, ERA, 1200hp and thermal FCS. An export upgrade conversion, AKA M-84D, is offered for Kuwaiti M-84A tanks..
The PT-91 is Polish upgrade tanks with ERA, Drawa improved FCS, Savan-5 thermal sight, improved gun stabilization, and countermeasures..
The PT-91M is Has a 1000hp engine, new guns and FCS, armor changes, and other improvements. PT-91M exported to Singapore. PT-91P is designed for export to Peru..
The T-72M1 is Demonstrator with 2nd generation ERA and other upgrades were displayed at military shows..
The T-72M1M is Includes 3rd generation Relikt ERA and optional Arena Active Protection System (APS). Alternative designations: Rogata and SMT M1988. It is almost the same as the T-72S (Export), except more ERA on the side skirts..
The AJEYA MK 2 is India is upgrading T-72A tanks close to a Bhishma (T-90S) standard..
