This document describes the M113A1 American Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The M113A1, informally known as the Gavin, is a lightly armored full tracked air transportable personnel carrier designed to carry personnel and certain types of cargo. The M113 family was developed from M59 and M75 by Ford and Kaiser Aluminium and Chemical Co. in the late 1950s. The vehicle is capable of: amphibious operations in streams and lakes; extended cross-country travel over rough terrain and high-speed operation on improved roads and highways.

The M113 Family includes approximately 12 variants of light armored tracked vehicles used in a variety of combat and combat support roles. The total density exceeds 28,000. Today's M113 Family of Vehicles is composed of a mix of derivative systems consisting of the A1, A2, and A3 configurations. The current fleet includes: M113A2; M113A3; M106A2; M1064; M1064A3; M548A1; M548A3; M577A2; M577A3; M730A2; M901A1; M981; M1068; M1068A3; M1059; and M1059A3. Over the next 10-15 years, the majority of these systems will be converted to the A3 configuration.
