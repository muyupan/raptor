This document describes the 1L122-1E Baurnal-T Russian Mobile Air Defense Command and Control System.

Barnaul-T is the baseline air defense command & control subsystem of the integrated troop and weapon management system designed to detect aerial targets and control air defense systems of the Army, marine units, and the Airborne Force. The Barnaul-T baseline air defense command and control subsystem is designed to fit tactical units’ air defense (AD) control posts (CP) with advanced automation, communication, and data exchange equipment in order to effectively control air defense troops and weapons, coordinate their activities, and increase their mobility and survivability under any combat conditions.

The systems use the 9S932-1 intelligence and control module with 1L122-1E radar mounted on a BTR-MD Rakushka amphibious tracked chassis or MT-LBU.

The new air defense control system use of automation equipment at the tactical level increases the efficiency of short-range SAM systems by up to 20% and reduces the expenditure of missiles per killed target by up to 30%.

The Barnaul-T baseline air defense command and control subsystem is designed to fit tactical units’ air defense (AD) control posts (CP) with advanced automation, communication, and data exchange equipment in order to effectively control air defense troops and weapons, coordinate their activities, and increase their mobility and survivability under any combat conditions.

The Barnaul-T baseline set is used to equip
*AD division/brigade CP (mission planning module (MPM) mounted on the 9S931-1 wheeled chassis);
*AD regiment CP (MP-K 9S931-1 and 9S931 MPM);
*AD battalion CP (9S931 MPM);
*Battery command and control (C2) post (9S932-1 reconnaissance and control vehicle with 1L122-1E radar);
*MANPADS platoon C2 post (9S933 portable fire control unit);
*SAM squad – 9S935 MANPADS squad automation equipment set.
 

The configuration of the Barnaul-T baseline set depends on the organizational structure of the Customer’s tactical military units.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Ukraine.
