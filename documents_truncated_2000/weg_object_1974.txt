This document describes the Heckler and Koch HK417 German 7.62mm Battle Rifle.

The Heckler & Koch HK417 is a battle rifle, designed and manufactured by Heckler & Koch in Germany. It is the larger caliber version of the HK416 and chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge. It is a gas-operated, selective-fire rifle with a rotating bolt. The HK417 is intended for use in roles where the penetrative power, stopping power, and range of the 7.62×51mm cartridge are required. It has been adopted for service by a number of armed forces, special forces, and police organizations.

The HK417 is similar in internal design to the HK416, although the receiver and working parts are enlarged to suit the larger 7.62×51mm cartridge. The bolt is a seven-lug rotating type, which sits in a bolt carrier and operates in a forged alloy receiver resembling those of the Stoner-designed AR-10, AR-15, and M16 rifles.

Like the HK416, the HK417 is gas-operated with a short-stroke piston design similar to that of the Heckler & Koch G36. The short-stroke piston is more reliable than the original direct impingement operation of the AR-15 design because, unlike these weapons, it does not vent propellant gases directly into the receiver, which deposits carbon fouling onto the bolt mechanism as well as heating it up.

The early HK417 prototype used 20-round magazines from the Heckler & Koch G3 rifle family, which did not feature a bolt hold-open device. Later prototypes, however, switched to a polymer magazine with bolt hold-open. The magazine resembles an enlarged version of the G36's transparent magazine, except without the pins for holding more than one magazine together.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Albania, Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America.

Here is Variants information for the Heckler and Koch HK417 German 7.62mm Battle Rifle:
The HK417 12″ 'Assaulter' is carbine with 304.8 mm (12 in) standard barrel.
The HK417 16″ 'Recce' is "Recon" rifle with 406.4 mm (16 in) standard or accurized barrel.
The HK417 20″ 'Sniper' is "full size" rifle with 508.0 mm (20 in) accurized barrel.
The HK417 A2 is The HK417 A2 is the improved version. The design of the receiver, barrel interface, gas port and the bore axis alignment of the rifle have been further optimised to increase its accuracy and reliability. The German Army uses the HK417 A2 - 13″ with the designation G27.

As of 2013, the HK417 A2 models chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO available to the military and law enforcement market are:

HK417 A2 - 13″: carbine with 330.2 mm (13 in) barrel
HK417 A2 - 16.5″: rifle with 419.1 mm (16.5 in) barrel
HK417 A2 - 20″: "full size" rifle with 508.0 mm (20 in) barrel

Accurized barrels provide 0.3 mil (1 moa) accuracy (with match grade ammunition). A barrel can be changed in under two minutes with simple tools. All HK417 barrels are cold hammer forged and chrome-lined and use a conventional lands and grooves bore profile with a twist rate of 1 turn in 279.4 mm (11.00 in). They are designed to function reliably with bullet weights ranging from 9.3 to 11.34 g (144 to 175 gr) and are threaded for a flash hider or sound suppressor..
The G28 is The civilian MR308 was used to develop the G28, a designated marksman rifle for the German Bundeswehr (Federal Army) deployment to the War in Afghanistan. The semi-automatic G28 is chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO and has a factory warrantied accuracy of 45 mm dispersion at 100 meters (0.45 mil or 1.5 moa) when fired with 10 rounds using OTM/HPBT/Sierra Match King ammunition. The G28 features STANAG 4694 NATO Accessory Rails that are backwards-compatible with the STANAG 2324/MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails. The upper receiver is made from steel instead of HK's aluminium alloy. Approximately 75% of the parts are interchangeable with the HK417. There are two different versions of the G28: G28 E2 (Standard) with a Schmidt & Bender 3–20×50 PM II (modified to Bundeswehr requirements) and the G28 E3 (Patrol) with Schmidt & Bender 1–8×24 PM II. By October 2017, Heckler & Koch had renamed the G28 as the HK241, though G28 remains its Bundeswehr designation..
The M110A1 is In April 2016 Heckler & Koch confirmed that a lighter version of the G28 had won the United States Army's Compact Semi-Automatic Sniper System contract to replace the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System. It is designated as the M110A1 and uses an aluminum upper receiver instead of steel to meet weight requirements, weighing 8.4 lb (3.8 kg) unloaded and reaching some 15 lb (6.8 kg) loaded and with accessories; the M110A1 features a Geissele M-LOK rail handguard, Schmidt & Bender 3–20×50 PM II Ultra Short telescopic sight, Geissele optic mount, OSS SRM6 suppressor, 6-9 Harris bipod and mount, and a collapsible stock with adjustable comb. In May 2018, the U.S. Marine Corps will begin receiving the CSASS, also to replace the M110..
The MR308 is The MR308 is a civilian variant of the HK417, introduced in 2007 alongside the MR223, a civilian HK416. It is a semi-automatic rifle with several "sporterized" features. At the 2009 SHOT Show, the two rifles were introduced to the American civilian market as the MR762 and MR556, respectively. Since then both were replaced by the improved MR762A1 and MR556A1..
