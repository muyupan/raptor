This document describes the JRTC VISMOD: 2S6M Tunguska-M Russian 30mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System.

The 2S6 Tunguska 2K22 (NATO code SA-19 Grison) is a Russian-made self-propelled air defense system which combines gun and missile armament. The development of the 2S6 Tunguska began in 1970 after a request by the Russian army for a new self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon system to replace the old ZSU-23-4 self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. The first version entered service in 1986 and had four missiles, two either side, in the ready to launch position. The second version to enter service with the Russian army, and the current production model vehicle, is designated the 2S6M or 2K22M, has eight missiles, four to each side of the turret. The Tunguska vehicle uses a tracked chassis GM-352M which is also used for the ground-to-air missile system Buk-M1 SA-11 Gadfly. A typical 2K22/2K22M battery would consist of six 2S6/2S6M self-propelled air defense vehicles, six reload vehicles and associated support and maintenance vehicles. The 2S6 Tunguska is intended to protect tank and motorized units from low-flying aircraft and helicopters, some types of cruise-missile, as well as to engage light armor ground targets and manpower of the enemy.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

Here is Radar 1 (Detection) information for the JRTC VISMOD: 2S6M Tunguska-M Russian 30mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System of the Radar System, 1RL144M:
The Name is 1RL144 Radar.
The Type is Detection Radar.
The Function is This radar provides primary search capability in addition to measurement of range and bearing.
The Frequency/Band is E-band.
The Maximum Range is 18.
The Antenna Location is Antenna is mounted at the rear of the turret and is folded down when not in use.
The Antenna Rotation is The antenna rotates at approximately 1 r/s, which gives a rapid update of the airspace around the 2S6M.
The Fan Beam is The TAR emits a fan beam covering 4.50 in azimuth and 150 in elevation. The beam is pointed at a constant elevation of 7.50 to permit detection of low-altitude targets..

Here is Radar 2 (Tracking) information for the JRTC VISMOD: 2S6M Tunguska-M Russian 30mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft System of the Radar System, 1RL144M:
The Name is 1RL144M.
The Type is Target Tracking Radar (TTR).
The Function is The tracking radar constantly relays target range, elevation and bearing to the fire-control computer, and on the basis if these data the computer generated the laying commands for the weapon system..
The Frequency/Band is J-band.
The Maximum Range is 16.
The Antenna Location is Antenna is mounted at the front section of the turret and has two fundamental functions that depend on whether the guns or missiles are selected..
The Optical Sight is A stabilized optical sight is used as a back up tracking channel, allowing target data to be relayed to the fire-control computer. This sight is also used to calculate the deviation of a missile's flight path from the line-of-sight, these data being automatically relayed to the fire control computer and used to generate correction signals..
The Gun Engagement is During a gun engagement, the TTR functions as an automatic target tracker, feeding target position data to the fire-control computer..
The Missile Engagement is During missile engagement, the tracking radar locks onto the target and then lays the optical sight on the target. Subsequently the gunner assumes the target-tracking function with the electro-optic sight, and the radar is used for relaying guidance commands to the SA-19 missile..
