This document describes the Bumbar (Bumble Bee) Serbian Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM).

Bumbar is an anti-tank/anti bunker weapon from Serbia. The Bumbar is a wire-guided, man-portable, short-range missile system. The missile has a soft launch capability, which means that the main motor fires after the missile have left the launcher, which allows for the missile to be fired from confined spaces, which is a necessity in urban warfare. During its flight, the rocket is maneuvered by a system of thrust vectoring. The missile is propelled by two main rocket motor exhaust vanes located at mid-body. As the missile rotates the launch units send signals commanding the correction by one of the two vanes to move against the missile motors thrust. For example, if the missile has to move to the left, the right thrust vector vane will actuate at the correct time. It is protected against electronic countermeasures through the use of CCD matrix sensors, fast image processing computers, and a robust missile tracer recognition algorithm.
Its general design is similar to the French/Canadian Eryx MBDA anti-tank missile.  All key components of the Bumbar system are indigenously developed by VTI - Military Technical Institute Belgrade Serbia.
Can be vehicle-mounted.  The primary purpose is to be deployed forward with infantry forces.
The weapon can be fired remotely offering protection to the crew.  The launcher is reusable.
Some sources state that the PH is 90% against moving targets under all conditions up to 600m.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Serbia.

Here is Missile information for the Bumbar (Bumble Bee) Serbian Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM):
The Engine is The Bumbar weapon system is powered by a solid propellant rocket motor consisting of two phases, which are boost and sustain. The boost phase develops enough thrust to propel the missile with high speed, while the sustain stage provides high thrust and flight velocity, allowing the missile to reach its target with minimum endurance.

The thrust vectoring system employs two thrust vector vanes to provide increased manoeuvrability during the flight..
The Caliber is 120.
The Secondary Missile Caliber is 55.
The Time of Flight to Target at 600m is 4.6.
The Warhead Penetration is Over 1000mm RHA behind ERA.
The Range is 60 to 600 m.
The Warhead Type is Tandem, shape charge.

Here is Fire Control information for the Bumbar (Bumble Bee) Serbian Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM):
The Guidance System is SACLOS wire guided.
