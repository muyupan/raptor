This document describes the BTR-D (BMD M1979) Russian Amphibious/Airborne Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The BTR-D (BMD M1979) Russian Amphibious/Airborne Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) is a Soviet airborne multi-purpose tracked armored personnel carrier that was introduced in 1974 and first seen by the West in 1979 during the Soviet-Afghan War. BTR-D stands for Bronetransportyor Desantis (БТР, Бронетранспортер Десанта, literally "armored transporter of the Airborne"). It is based on the BMD-1 airborne IFV. NATO gave it the designation BMD M1979.

While the BTR-D is based on the BMD-1, it is 60 mm longer and lacks a turret; instead, it has a small flat superstructure with a hatch on top.
Crew

The crew consists of the driver, the commander, and the left bow-mounted machine gun gunner, all of whom are in the same positions and have the same equipment as in the BMD-1.

Armament
Although the turret with all of the main armament was removed, the two bow-mounted machine guns have been retained. However, the original PKT tank machine guns have been replaced by PKB general-purpose machine guns. The vehicle can also be fitted with pintle-mounted automatic grenade launchers (AGS-17, AGS-30, or AGS-57) and/or machine guns (PKM, 6P41, "Utyos" or "Kord").

Maneuverability
The BTR-D is powered by the same engine as the BMD-1, however, its suspension is longer because the entire vehicle has been lengthened by 60 mm. Because of this, the vehicle has six road wheels on each side instead of five. It also has five return rollers on each side unlike the BMD-1, which has four.


Armour protection
The armor protection is slightly better on the BTR-D than on the BMD-1. That's because the upper front armor has a dual slanted angle.

Troop compartment
Because the turret has been removed, the troop compartment has been enlarged and can carry up to ten fully equipped soldiers. It's also linked with the crew compartment in the front. Also, there are two firing ports on the sides and one in the rear, two of which are for RPK-74 light machine guns.

Equipment
The BTR-D has all the same equipment as the BMD-1 but also has towing equipment for ZU-23-2 twin AA autocannon.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Belarus, CFE Treaty, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam.
