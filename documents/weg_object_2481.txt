This document describes the 2S9 Anona (SO-120) Russian 120mm Amphibious Self-Propelled Mortar.

2S9 Anona (SO-120) Russian 120mm Amphibious Self-Propelled Mortar (SPM) was developed in the 1970s to improve the mobility of mortars serving with the air assault divisions. Additionally, it provides direct fire and anti-tank capability. The 2S9 is the most numerous gun mortar vehicle in the world. The chassis of the BTR-D armored personnel carrier serves as the basis for the 2S9. In the middle of the vehicle a turret is placed that is fitted with gun mortar. The commander and driver are seated in the hull and the gunner and loader are in the turret. The 2A51 breech loaded 120mm smoothbore gun mortar is the main armament of the 2S9. The turret allows for a limited traverse left and right. The maximum effective range is 8.8 km and 13 km with assisted ammunition. The rate of fire is 6 to 8 rounds per minute. As a gun mortar, it is capable of direct fire and special HEAT ammunition is available for use against armored vehicles. There is no secondary armament.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Belarus, CFE Treaty, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam.
