This document describes the Type 037IG Class (Houxin Class) Chinese Corvette.

The Type 037IG missile boat (NATO: Houxin class) were first built by Qiuxing and Huangpu Shipyard from 1991 through 1999 for the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). In addition to the PLAN, 6 were exported to Myanmar: 2 in 1995, 2 in July 1996, and 2 in late 1997. This boat is the anti-ship version of the Type 037 submarine chasers, armed with missiles rather than torpedoes. It is most effectively used in conjunction with multiple missile boats to send a swarm of missiles towards its intended target and then egress from the area immediately. The swarm of anti-ship missiles will hopefully slip past the target's air defenses for at least one or possibly more hits.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Myanmar.
