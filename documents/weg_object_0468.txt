This document describes the M77 Oganj Yugoslav 128mm Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL).

The M77 Oganj Yugoslav 128mm Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL) is configured and operated in the same manner as the Czechoslovakian 122mm (40 round) multiple rocket launcher RM-70. The launcher is mounted over the rear axles with the reloader located behind the cab. During reloading, the launcher is rotated to the rear, two hydraulic cylinders raise the reloader, and then the rockets are pushed into the launcher. Unlike the RM-70, the M77 uses hydraulic cylinders rather than a sprocket and chain drive mechanism. The modified FAP2026 truck has four hydraulically emplaced firing jacks to provide firing stability. The rockets can be fired from inside the cab or with a remote-firing device. The M77 MRL is capable of mounting an anti-aircraft machine gun for protection.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia.
