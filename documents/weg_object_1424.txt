This document describes the Belyanka-Class (Project 11510 Class) Russian Radioactive Waste Tanker.

The Belyanka-Class (Project 11510 Class) Russian Radioactive Waste Tanker were built to receive, transport, and store liquid and solid radioactive waste. The ships are equipped with a special filter to reduce the radioactive content of liquid waste. They were formerly used to dump radioactive waste at sea.

Each ship has a storage capacity of 800 mÂ³ of liquid radioactive waste. The liquid is filtered through a special filtering installation onboard the vessel. The design criteria are to reduce the radioactive content by a factor of one thousand. The filter can process 120 tons of liquid waste per day; however, the filter plant has never satisfied the design criteria with regard to the reduction of radioactive content. The maximum permissible activity is set at 370 MBq/l-370 kBq/l (10-2-10-5 Ci/l). Each vessel also has two holds for the storage of solid radioactive waste.

One hold has a capacity of 600 tons of waste loaded in containers; while the other can accommodate 400 tons. The waste may be of varying activity and physical dimensions.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
