This document describes the DF-11 (Dongfeng 11) Chinese Close-Range Ballistic Missile.

The Dong Feng-11 (DF-11) is a road-mobile, nuclear-capable, close-range ballistic missile developed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC). A solid-fuel SRBM launched from a transporter erector launcher (TEL), the DF-11 can be launched with roughly 30 minutes of preparation and can reach ranges up to 300km. While the DF-11 has an estimated accuracy of 200m CEP, the PRC is reportedly working to increase its accuracy to 30 CEP by 2020 through the addition of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and laser guidance systems.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Myanmar, Pakistan.

Here is Variants information for the DF-11 (Dongfeng 11) Chinese Close-Range Ballistic Missile:
The DF-11A (CSS-7 Mod 2) is A lengthened, improved variant of the DF-11, the DF-11A offers an increased range, larger payload, and improved accuracy. Development began in 1993, and its existence was first reported in 1998. The DF-11A measures 8.5 m long and weighs approximately 4,200 kg. It can carry a 500 kg payload over a reported range of 500 – 600 km. The missile features an inertial navigation/satellite guidance system and can reach accuracies of 150-200 m CEP. Unconfirmed reports suggest that an optical correlation terminal guidance system was later fitted, which could further improve accuracy to 20-30 m CEP. China first flight tested the DF-11A in 1997, and the missile entered service with the China People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Second Artillery Corps in 1999..
The DF-11AZT is The DF-11AZT is a variant of the DF-11A thought to feature an earth-penetrating warhead. Images of the system were first broadcast by Chinese state media in 2016; it reportedly entered service some time before 2013..
