This document describes the TMM-6 Russian 8x8 Truck-Mounted Scissors Bridge.

The TMM-6 is a vehicle-launched bridge system of Russian origin. It was developed in the 1990s to replace older bridge launching systems with a more capable bridge system. The name TMM-6 stands for Tyazhelo Mekhniznrovanny Most 6, which is Russian for heavy mechanized bridge 6. It is also known as the Gusenitsa-2 with the Gusenitsa-1 being the MTU-90 bridge layer based on the T-90 chassis.


The TMM-6 functions in a similar way as the older TMM system but is a much larger and heavier system. An MZKT-7930 8x8 truck chassis is used as the launch vehicle. A 17 m folded scissor bridge is carried at the rear of a vehicle. The bridge is launched rearwards using a hydraulic arm and rests on the river floor by means of two variable-length struts. Normally six TMM-6 would form a unit and together are able to create a 102-meter bridge. The TMM-6 is an unarmed vehicle and has no armor but does feature an NBC system. 

A single bridge section has a length of 17 meters and an infinite number can be connected and a single MTU-90 section can be fitted on one end. Six vehicles would make up a single unit and result in a 102-meter bridge. The bridge sections can be laid in gaps and water between 2 and 5 meters deep. Creating a 102-meter bridge requires 50 minutes. The bridge has a 60 t weight capacity and may carry up to 400 vehicles per hour that may move at speeds up to 30 km/h.


The TMM-6 is used in small quantities with the Russian army and is available for export.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, CFE Treaty, Russian Federation.
