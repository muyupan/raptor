This document describes the PARM 2 German Off-Route Mine.

The PARM 1 (DM-12) and PARM 2 are German off-route mines that fire small fin stabilized rockets.

The mine was developed in the early 1980s to meet the US MIL-STD-331A and US MIL-STD-810C requirements. Trials of the mine were conducted between March 1983 and March 1988. In June 1988 it was accepted into service with the German army, with the Army receiving the first batch of 25,000 between 1991 and 1994. The PARM 2 was a development of PARM 1 incorporating an infra-red sensor, and an improved rocket.

The PARM 2 incorporates an infra-red sensor, the SAPIR, which acts to accurately fire the rocket to ranges up to 100 meters. The warhead of the PARM 2 has been upgraded, with an armour penetration of 750 millimeters and a capability against reactive armour. It can be programmed to be active from between hours and 30 days.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Germany.
