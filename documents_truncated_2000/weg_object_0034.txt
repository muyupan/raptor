This document describes the PT-76 Russian Light Amphibious Tank.

The PT-76 is a Soviet amphibious light tank designed in 1948 which saw service from 1952 up until its gradual retirement from 1967 onwards, partly replaced by the more versatile BMP-1 APC. Characterized by a wide hull and water jet propulsion, the PT-76 offered excellent amphibious capabilities. It was, however, plagued by a large silhouette, weak armor protection, and an underpowered 76 mm gun. Despite these flaws, the PT-76 enjoyed a long service life within the Soviet and Russian armed forces, which only placed it into its reserves in 2006. Comparable to other Soviet Cold War vehicles, it has seen combat in several wars and is still in use within smaller armies. Russia is attempting to replace them with BMP-3F amphibious IFVs.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Benin, Cambodia, Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Madagascar, Nicaragua, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), South Korea (Republic of Korea), Uganda, Viet Nam, Zambia.
