This document describes the POM-3 (Medallion) Russian Anti-Personnel Mine.

The POM-3 Russian Anti-Personnel Mine is a high-explosive (HE), scatterable, anti-personnel (AP), bounding fragmentation, self-destruct landmine designed to be dispersed/ejected from a variety of airborne and ground delivery systems. On dispersal from its container, the landmine is orientated by the use of a parachute. The POM-3 uses a proximity seismic fuze with a self-destruct time of either 8 or 24hrs. Once in a suitable position, a seismic rod sensor is forced into the ground. It is intended to bury itself into the ground to a depth of its body height. If it lands on hard ground, six spring-loaded feet deploy and position the landmine in an upright position.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.

Here is System information for the POM-3 (Medallion) Russian Anti-Personnel Mine:
The Alternate Designation is POM-3; Medallion Russian.
The Type is Anti-Personnel Mine.
The Manufacturer is INA.
The Fuze is The POM-3 uses a proximity seismic fuze.
The Killing Radius is 16 m. On sensing a suitable seismic signature the base unit ejects a fragmentation charge into the air that contains metal fragmentation rings that detonate sending fragmentation out to a lethal radius of 16 meters..
The Dispersal is On dispersal from its container, the landmine is orientated by the use of a parachute..
The Soft Ground is If it lands in soft ground, it is intended to bury itself into the ground to a depth of its body height..
The Hard Ground is If it lands on hard ground, six spring-loaded feet deploy and position the landmine in an upright position..
The Self-Destruct Time is 8-24 hours.
