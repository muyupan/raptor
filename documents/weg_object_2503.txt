This document describes the Eagle I Swiss 4x4 Reconnaissance Vehicle.

The MOWAG Eagle is a wheeled armored vehicle designed by the Swiss MOWAG corporation. It has gone through several generations of development. The current vehicle, introduced in November 2003, is the Eagle IV, which is based on the Duro IIIP chassis. The original MOWAG Eagle used the chassis and running gear of the United States Humvee, while the Eagle II and Eagle III use the chassis and running gear of the Humvee ECV. A Prototype is now part of the Military Museum Full. The MOWAG Eagle IV and V used the chassis and running gear of the Mowag Duro.

A modular 6Ã—6 variant that was developed for an Australian Army tender made its market debut at Eurostatory 2012.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Denmark, Germany, Switzerland.
