This document describes the BTR-80A Russian 8x8 Amphibious Armored Personnel Carrier (APC).

The BTR-80 has evolved into the BTR-80A. In 1993, the Tula design bureau finished the development of a new turret similar to that on the German Marder APC, mounting a 30-mm 2A42 (BMP-2) automatic gun, coax 7.62-mm MG and TNP-3 day/night sights. This vehicle is in prototype and offered for export. The drop-in gun/turret package (Modular Weapon System) is offered for export, to upgrade a wide variety of vehicles to BTR-80A standard. BTR-80A can mount K1-126 bullet-resistant tires. On the BTR-80A and BTR-80S, the standard BTR-80 turret is replaced with a modular armaments system. The BTR-80A is fitted with a 30 mm 2A72 automatic gun and a 7.62 mm PKT coaxial machine gun.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, CFE Treaty, Colombia, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Turkmenistan.
