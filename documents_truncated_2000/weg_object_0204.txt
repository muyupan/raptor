This document describes the Rubezh-ME Russian Short-Range Anti-Ship Cruise Missile.

At IMDS 2019, a new version of the Russian Bal-E coastal defence system is presented for the 1st time. The Rubezh-ME, dedicated to the export market, is based on a Kamaz 63501 8x8 chassis which is more compact than the MZKT-7930 of the original Bal-E.

The Rubezh-ME still uses the same familly of KH-35 anti-ship missile. The system is paired with its Monolith-B self-propelled commmand vehicle with control and communication unit. The Rubez-ME can be deployed in less than 15 min, be positioned up to 1km above sea level and 10km from the coast line.

The Monolith-B radar allows the Rubezh-ME to engage targets up to 250 km in active mode and up to 450km in passive mode, the systems also allows to track 30 targets in active mode, 50 in passive detection mode and 10 in targeting mode. The KH-35E missile has a range of 5 to 130km and the KH-35UE allows the Rubezh-ME to engage from 7 to 260km.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
