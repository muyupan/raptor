This document describes the DJI Matrice 30T Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The DJI Matrice 30T Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is the DJI Enterprise flagship, a weatherproof drone that fits in a backpack. It integrates multiple high-performance sensors into one single camera payload, is controlled with the DJI RC Plus Remote, and runs on upgraded DJI Pilot 2 software, which significantly improves the flight experience. The powerful M30T offers the endurance and capability necessary for rugged professional use cases. Additionally, its size makes it ideal for easy transportation and fast setup. The UAS also includes a 40mm 640x512 30fps thermal imaging camera with a measurement accuracy of ±2°C or ±2%.

Apart from its outstanding performance and new format, the DJI M30T allows professionals to fly and perform beyond their immediate surroundings. It integrates smoothly with the new DJI FlightHub 2 fleet management cloud-based software and the DJI Dock for collaboration with remote and unattended operations, bringing efficiency innovation to various industries.

The M30T model integrates a 48-megapixel 1/2'' CMOS sensor-zoom camera with 5×~16× optical and 200× digital zoom, a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, 8K photo, 4K/30 fps video resolution, and a laser rangefinder which can give the precise coordinates of objects up to 1,200 meters away.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
