This document describes the GMI-100 Rockan Swedish Anti-Invasion Shallow Water Mine.

The Rockan is an anti-invasion ground mine optimized for shallow water. This bottom-influence mine can also be laid in deeper waters as an anti-submarine mine.

The Rockan has an unusual wedge shape that enables the mine to glide through the water. Its low profile hinders sonar detection, and the irregular shape and glass-reinforced plastic casing provide visual camouflage. Its anechoic and nonferrous construction reduces the acoustic and magnetic signature.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Serbia, Sweden.
