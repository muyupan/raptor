This document describes the ZALA 421-08 Russian Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The ZALA-421-08 is a small, hand-launched unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed for short-range surveillance and reconnaissance operations.

The air vehicle is of a flying-wing design, propelled by a single electric pusher propeller. The aircraft is equipped with a GPS-based navigation system.

Swarming tactics with multiple UAVs can be employed through automatic and ground control systems. Voice-based mission reporting and planning capabilities are also under development.

A standard ZALA-421-08 system includes two air vehicles and a portable ground control station, as well as two sets of spare batteries. The ground station offers a video resolution of 720 x 756 pixels in an MPEG2 format.

The payload includes two cameras. Color, monochrome and infrared cameras can be fitted. The standard layout is a high-resolution monochrome camera facing forward and down, while a color camera faces down and to the side.

The air vehicle is launched by hand and recovered by parachute.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
