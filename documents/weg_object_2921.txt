This document describes the KORAL Turkish Land-Based Radar Electronic Warfare System.

KORAL Land Based Radar Electronic Warfare System is designed and manufactured by the Turkish Defense Company Aselsan. The KORAL system is composed of two MAN 8x8 military trucks, each carrying an element of the system. One is the Radar Electronic Support (ES System) and one multi Radar Electronic Attack (EA) system to cover the full spectrum. Both systems can be positioned at a distance of 500 m from each other. This electronic defense/electronic attack system is designed to jam and deceive conventional and complex types of hostile radar, and analyzes multiple target signals in a wide frequency range, automatically generating appropriate response thanks to its digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) capability.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Azerbaijan, Turkey.
