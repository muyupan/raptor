CSK141 shares similar electronics with CSK131 such as computers, satellite suites,s and night vision cameras. This vehicle features unusual clamshell doors on either side which the door divides into the upper and lower part. It's one of the two principal light armored vehicles currently fielded by PLA. All CSK-141 are equipped with a remote-controlled turret that can be mounted with machine guns, anti-tank missiles, and grenade launchers. The Dongfeng EQ2101 variants feature a 6x6 configuration, and the CS/VN11 is the export version. First released in 2016, CS/VN11 has conventional side doors instead of clamshell-type side doors.

The CTL-181A UAV Swarm is The CTL-181A UAV Swarm is fitted with a multiple launch system capable of launching small UAV/loitering munition. Four of the tubes launch smaller SULA30 drones, which are scouts with over an hour of flight time, according to reporting from China’s state-owned Global Times. The remaining eight tubes will hold larger SULA89 drones, which can carry over 4 pounds of explosives and crash into targets at a speed of over 177 km/h. The scout drones can relay information back to humans in a command center, but it’s unclear if the one-way drone missiles will fly to targets selected by humans or make the choice of the target while in transit. The volume of drones launched, and the way rocket artillery is designed to fire rapidly in salvos, suggest that human control would largely be limited to target selection before firing..
