This document describes the M577 American Armored Command Vehicle.

The M577 command post vehicle is a member of the BAE Systems Ground Systems (previously United Defense) M113 series of full-tracked Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) family of armored fighting vehicles. Its correct US Army designation is Carrier, Command Post, Light Tracked M577.

The M113 armored personnel carrier was developed by the FMC (Food Machinery Corp.) based on M59 and M75 armored personnel carriers from the 1950s. The first prototype of M113 was produced in 1957. The US Army adopted the vehicle in 1960. Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical produced the aluminum required for the development of M113.

FMC transferred the production of M113 vehicles to its new subsidiary, the United Defense in 1994. United Defense was acquired by BAE in 2005.

As of November 2011, more than 80,000 M113 vehicles were produced in different variants. The vehicle is operational in more than 44 countries.

The M113 is a fully tracked armored personnel carrier (APC) that was developed and produced by the Food Machinery Corp (FMC). The M113 was sent to USAREUR to replace the mechanized infantry's M59 APCs in the 1961/62 time frame. The M113 was first tried out in combat in April 1962 after the United States provided the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) with heavy weaponry such as the M113, under the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) program. Eventually, the M113 was the most widely used armored vehicle of the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War, earning the nickname 'Green Dragon'[dubious – discuss][citation needed] by the Viet Cong as it was used to break through heavy thickets in the midst of the jungle to attack and overrun enemy positions. It was largely known as an "APC" or an "ACAV" (armored cavalry assault vehicle) by the allied forces.

The M113 was the first aluminum hull combat vehicle to be put into mass production, it introduced new aluminum armor that made the vehicle much lighter than earlier vehicles; it was thick enough to protect the crew and passengers against small arms fire but light enough that the vehicle was air transportable and moderately amphibious. In the U.S. Army, the M113 series have long been replaced as front-line combat vehicles by the M2 and M3 Bradleys, but large numbers are still used in support roles such as armored ambulance, mortar carrier, engineer vehicle, and command vehicle. The U.S. Army's heavy brigade combat teams are equipped with approximately 6,000 M113s and 4,000 Bradleys.

The M113's versatility spawned a wide variety of adaptations that live on worldwide, and in U.S. service. These variants together currently represent about half of U.S. Army armored vehicles. To date, it is estimated that over 80,000 M113s of all types have been produced and used by over 50 countries worldwide, making it one of the most widely used armored fighting vehicles of all time. The Military Channel's Top Ten series named the M113 the most significant infantry vehicle in history.

The U.S. Army planned to retire the M113 family of vehicles by 2018, seeking replacement with the GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicle program, but now replacement of the M113 has fallen to the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program. Thousands of M113s continue to see combat service in the Israel Defense Forces, although as of 2014 the IDF was seeking to gradually replace many of its 6,000 M113s, with Namer APCs.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Benin, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Cambodia, Congo, Ecuador, Germany, Guatemala, Norway, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Korea (Republic of Korea), Spain, Sudan, Switzerland, Ukraine, United States of America, Uruguay, Viet Nam, Yemen.
