This document describes the SPG-9 Kopye (Spear) Russian 73mm Tripod-Mounted Man-Portable Recoilless Gun.

The SPG-9 Kopye (Spear) is a tripod-mounted man-portable, 73-millimeter caliber recoilless gun developed by the Soviet Union. It fires fin-stabilized, rocket-assisted HE and HEAT projectiles similar to those fired by the 73 mm 2A28 Grom low-pressure gun of the BMP-1 armored vehicle. It was accepted into service in 1962, replacing the B-10 recoilless rifle.

The projectile is launched from the gun by a small charge, which gives it an initial velocity of between 250 and 400 meters per second. The launch charge also imparts spin to the projectile by a series of offset holes. Once the projectile has traveled approximately 20 meters (65.6 feet) from the launcher, a rocket motor in its base ignites. For the PG-9 projectile, this takes it to a velocity of 700 meters per second (2,297 feet per second) before the motor burns out.

The SPG-9 is light, and is normally transported by vehicle, and carried into position by its two crew. It can be deployed in around a minute. The weapon is in service with a large number of armed forces, and a variety of ammunition is produced; however, they are mostly copies of the original Soviet PG-9 HEAT and OG-9 FRAG-HE rounds.

The SPG-9 is widely available to terrorists and maritime pirates such as in the Horn of Africa region, as well as in other regions to a lesser degree. It is not as popular as the RPG-7 because it has to be mounted on a vehicle or boat and cannot be easily carried and shoulder-fired. The SPG-9 requires much more skill to fire accurately than the RPG-7. There have been reports of these mounted in skiffs and larger "mother ships". The SPG-9 can typically be found mounted on a wide variety of vehicles known as "technicals" in Somalia.

A variant for use with airborne troops including detachable wheels was built as the SPG-9D.

The SPG-9 was used by both sides during the Transnistria War, with at least one combat kill: a T-64BV of Russian peacekeepers was destroyed using an SPG.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Central African Republic, Cuba, Egypt, Georgia, Grenada, Hungary, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Mali, Mongolia, Nepal, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Viet Nam.
