This document describes the Tripartite Class Belgian Minehunter.

Originally ten ships were ordered for the Belgian Navy, with the option for five more that was never activated. The Polyship consortium was organized to direct the building program, however, the consortium was dissolved, leading to delays in the construction of the minehunters. This led to the vessels being reordered this time from Béliard Shipyard, which constructed the hulls at their yard in Ostend, Belgium before completing the minehunters at Rupelmonde. Differences between the Belgian and French versions of the class include a smaller displacement at 519 tons (511 long tons) standard and 574 tones (565 long tons) at full load. They are equipped with an Atlas Elektronik IMCMS combat data system. When Minehunting, the Belgian vessels carry six divers and can have a portable decompression chamber installed abaft the forecastle break.

All vessels in the class are named after flowers and are thus sometimes called the "Flower" or Aster class. In 2001 the remaining Belgian minehunters had their engines upgraded. All remaining Belgian vessels have undergone an extensive upgrade during 2004–2008 involving replacement of the anti-mine warfare equipment. This included receiving the same sonar package as the French versions. The complement of the Belgian ships varies between 33 and 46 depending on the mission.

Ships in class (Belgium)
In 1993, three of the vessels (Iris, Fuschia, and Dianthus) were paid off and laid up until being sold in 1997 to France. Crocus was modified into an ammunition transfer vessel the same year. Myosotis was converted to an ammunition transport before being taken out of service in 2004 and was sold to Bulgaria in 2009.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Belgium.
