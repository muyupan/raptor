This document describes the M-37 (82-BM-37) Russian 82mm Mortar.

The M-37 or 82-BM-37 is a Soviet 82-millimeter caliber mortar designed by B.I. Szayrin and accepted into service in 1937. The design of the M-37 is based on the earlier French Brandt mle 27/31 mortar with Russian modifications. The main difference between the 82-PM-37 and the earlier 82-PM-36 was the adoption of around base-plate, revised traverse/elevation controls, simplified sights, and spring-loaded shock absorbers on the bi-pod to reduce the amount of relaying needed between shots. The German designation for captured M-37 mortars was 8.2 cm GrW 274/2(r).

The M-37M is an improved version with a lighter base plate and a device to prevent double loading.

It was produced in China by Norinco as the Type 53, in Egypt by the Helwan Machine Tools Company as the Model 69, and in Bulgaria by Arsenal as the M-82 Mod 1937.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Central African Republic, China, Congo, Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Grenada, Guinea, Hungary, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Malta, Morocco, Nicaragua, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Ukraine, United States of America, Viet Nam.
