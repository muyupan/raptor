This document describes the KJ-200 (Moth) Chinese Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft.

The KJ-200 (NATO reporting name: Moth or Y-8 Balance Beam system, is an Airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) program developed by Shaanxi Aircraft Corporation. (KJ is from the first characters of the Pinyin spelling of 空警, (Kōng Jǐng), short for 空中预警 (Kōng Zhōng Yù Jǐng), which means Airborne Early Warning).

The key component of this aircraft is an AESA radar system, visually similar to the Saab Erieye system, mounted on struts above the rear fuselage, as well as ventral sensor domes. The platform of this aircraft is based on the Shaanxi Y-8F-600 and it has been reported that Pratt & Whitney Canada PW150B turboprops and Honeywell avionics have been incorporated.

The general designer of the KJ-200 is Ouyang Shaoxiu (欧阳绍修), the same general designer of the Y-8. According to Ouyang the KJ-200 has been significantly modified (around 80%) from the original Y-8. including the adoption of a glass cockpit.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.

Here is Variants information for the KJ-200 (Moth) Chinese Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft:
The KJ-2000 (Mainring) Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) Aircraft is KJ-2000 (Mainring) is an airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft designed and developed by AVIC Xi’an Aircraft Industry Company for the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).

The aircraft can detect, identify and track enemy targets flying at low altitudes and at long ranges. It can also be used to carry out command and control, battle management and airborne surveillance missions in all weather conditions.

The aircraft was developed based on the airframe of A-50I (Mainstay) AEW&C aircraft. The first prototype of KJ-2000 performed its maiden flight in November 2003 and the first production aircraft entered into service with the PLAAF in 2004.

An additional three aircrafts were delivered by the end of 2007. The aircrafts are operated by the 26th Air Division of the PLAAF.

The KJ-2000 aircraft was displayed at the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition 2014 (Airshow China 2014) held in Zhuhai..
