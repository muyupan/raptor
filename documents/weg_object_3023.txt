This document describes the Mi-6 (Hook A) Russian Heavy Transport Helicopter.

The Mi-6 (Hook A) Russian Heavy Transport Helicopter was first flown in 1957. This thing is a monster. It is huge. You feel tiny when you stand beside it. It looks far too big to be able to hover. It was a Soviet heavy transport helicopter built in large numbers for both military and civil roles. It had a crew of 6; pilot, co-pilot, navigator, flight engineer, radio operator, and technician. It had a top speed of 186 mph (300km/h) with a range of 385 miles (620 km).

The Mil Mi-6 is famous for what it could carry: 90 passengers or 70 airborne troops or 41 stretcher cases with 2 medical personnel or up to 12,000 kg (26,400 lb) of internal cargo. It had a service ceiling of 14,750 ft (4,500 m). More than 800 of these heavy-lift helicopters were built before production ended in 1981. It was replaced by the Mil Mi-26 in the 1990s

The Mil-6 Hook heavy transport helicopter was built for the Soviet Air forces and Aeroflot. The helicopter was designed to meet the needs for a machine able to transport heavy trucks, tracked vehicles, oil installations, and other cumbersome loads, as well as for the teams of geologists working in Siberia. Getting this giant of a helicopter in the air is not an easy design task. The Mi-6 Hook has an enormous gearbox, heavier than its engines, and often uses short wings to relieve the load on the rotor in cruise. The Mi-6 was powered by twin Soloviev D-25V (TB-2BM) turboshaft engines with 4,100 kW (5,500 SHP) each. It held the record for being the largest and fastest helicopter for a number of years. The large, five-blade main rotor is centered over the fuselage midsection. The fuselage is long and bus-like, with a round, stepped-up cockpit and round, glassed-in nose section and fixed landing gear. Bulged windows were mounted on the pilot's and copilot's doors to provide visibility down and to the rear. Standard avionics provided day-night, all-weather flight capability. Military variants included an "identification friend or foe (IFF)" transponder and a radar warning receiver (RWR) system.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), Peru, Poland, Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, Zimbabwe.
