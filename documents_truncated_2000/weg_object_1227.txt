This document describes the JRTC VISMOD: 2B16 Nona-K Russian 120mm Towed Combination Gun.

2B16 Nona-K is a 120mm towed gun based on the 120mm Nona gun which also served as the basis for the 2S9 Nona-S and 2S23 Nona-SVK self-propelled guns. Nona-K combines the capabilities of a gun, a mortar, and a howitzer into a single weapon system that can effectively engage troops, fortifications, and armored vehicles. To do so, this artillery system is capable of firing HE-fragmentation, shaped-charge Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAPs), 120mm HE-fragmentation, illuminating, smoke and incendiary mortar rounds including those designed for NATO's 120mm mortars.

The Russian Army has deployed Nona-K gun systems within motorized infantry battalions. Its effectiveness as been deemed similar to standard 152/155mm HE-fragmentation howitzer ammunition. The Nona-M1 is a special version designed for use by Russian airborne troops. It was introduced in late 2011 and is capable of hitting targets at ranges between 200 and 12,000 meters.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China, Russian Federation, Syria, Ukraine.
