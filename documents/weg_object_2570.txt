This document describes the ZBD-04A Chinese Amphibious Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV).

The ZBD-04A is an upgraded version of the ZBD-04. It forms the base platform for several other vehicles and carries improved armor but reduced mobility over the ZBD-04. It is the primary vehicle of Chinaâ€™s mechanized infantry brigades and provides sufficient firepower and protection to transport a section of fully-equipped infantry into a high-intensity battle. It is designed to operate alongside the Type 99A MBT and conduct mobile operations as part of a combined arms formation. The ZBD-04A was displayed in public for the first time during the 2015 Victory Day parade through Beijing, although development was completed the year before.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: China.
