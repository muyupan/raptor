This document describes the Su-27 (Flanker) Russian Multirole Fighter Aircraft.

The Sukhoi Su-27 (NATO reporting name: Flanker) is a Soviet-origin twin-engine supermaneuverable fighter aircraft designed by Sukhoi. It was intended as a direct competitor for the large United States fourth-generation fighters such as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle, with 3,530-kilometre (1,910 nmi) range, heavy aircraft ordnance, sophisticated avionics, and high maneuverability. The Su-27 was designed for air superiority missions, and subsequent variants are able to perform almost all aerial warfare operations. It was designed with the Mikoyan MiG-29 as its complement.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Angola, CFE Treaty, China, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russian Federation, Ukraine, United States of America, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam.

Here is Variants information for the Su-27 (Flanker) Russian Multirole Fighter Aircraft:
The T-10 "Flanker-A" is Initial prototype configuration..
The T-10S is Improved prototype configuration, more similar to production spec..
The P-42 is Special version built to beat climb time records. The aircraft had all armament, radar and paint removed, which reduced weight to 14,100 kg (31,100 lb). It also had improved engines. Similar to the US F-15 Streak Eagle project. Between 1986–1988, it established and took several climb records from the Streak Eagle. Several of these records (such as time to climb to 3000 m, 6000 m, 9000 m, and 12000 m) still stands current as of 2019..
