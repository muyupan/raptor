This document describes the P-15M (Squat Eye) Russian Mobile Ground-Based Air Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar.

Squat Eye** is a ground-based air surveillance and target acquisition radar associated with the SA-3 Goa** surface-to-air missile (SAM) system. Squat Eye works in conjunction with the Low Blow ** missile fire control radar to supply an air-defense site's coverage of low-altitude targets.
The radar is distinguished by its open-work elliptical parabolic antenna usually mounted on a 30-m (98-ft) mast. The reflector is fed by an underslung feed horn, which further emphasizes its low-altitude orientation.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Mali, Moldova, Mozambique, Peru, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia.
