This document describes the M47 Dragon American Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM).

M47 Dragon American Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) is an American shoulder-fired, man-portable anti-tank guided missile system. It was phased out of U.S. military service in 2001, in favor of the newer FGM-148 Javelin system.

The M47 Dragon uses a wire-guidance system in concert with a high explosive anti-tank warhead and was capable of defeating armored vehicles, fortified bunkers, main battle tanks, and other hardened targets. While it was primarily created to defeat the Soviet Union's T-55, T-62, and T-72 tanks, it saw use well into the 1990s, seeing action in the Persian Gulf War. The United States destroyed the last of its stocks of the missile in 2009.  The weapon system remains in active service with other militaries around the world.

The launcher system of the M47 Dragon consists of a smoothbore fiberglass tube, breech/gas generator, tracker, bipod, battery, sling, and forward and aft shock absorbers. In order to fire the weapon, non-integrated day or night sights must be attached. While the launcher itself is expendable, the sights can be removed and reused.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Thailand.
