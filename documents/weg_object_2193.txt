This document describes the Hydrema 910 Danish Mine Clearing Vehicle.

The Hydrema 910 MCV mine clearing vehicle was designed for military and peacekeeping operations. Production commenced in 1996. This mine clearing vehicle is in service with Denmark. The MCV has been described as a »medieval mechanism” and a “mine munching monster”, and this 10 metres long, 18 tonnes heavy machine does have a somewhat intimidating effect on the viewer when the flail and its 72 chains start rotating and the hammers at the ends of the chains dig into the ground, often accompanied by a large cloud of dust. The effect on the mines is also very convincing - the mines are either detonated or torn apart.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Denmark, India, Norway, Singapore, United States of America.
