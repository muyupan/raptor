This document describes the Monolit-B Russian Coastal Surface and Air Surveillance System .

The Monolit-B Russian Coastal Surface and Air Surveillance System is a coastal long-range surface-sea and air reconnaissance system featuring over-the-horizon active and passive radar capabilities. The radar system provides detection and tracking of surface targets by active radar while delivering target information for other assets in support of anti-ship missiles guidance. Using the passive radar mode, the Monolit-B can detect targets over-the-horizon such as surface ships. The radar system also includes Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF) capabilities as well as network warfare capabilities providing secure target data to other assets such as coastal defense missile systems utilizing Data Exchange and Oriental Radar (DEORdr). The Monolit-B radar system in integrated onto an 8x8 truck system. The active radar system is able to detect surface targets at a range of 35 to 100 kilometers depending on the altitude above the sea level. Under super refraction conditions the Monolit-B active radar can detect a surface target at 250 kilometers. The passive radar can detect a target at a distance of up to 450 kilometers. In fire control radar mode the Monolit-B can provide guidance against targets at a maximum range of 30 kilometers. The radar system can monitor up to 200 surface targets tracking up to 50 targets in passive mode or up to 30 in active mode while providing target designation for up 10.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Russian Federation.
