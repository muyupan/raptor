This document describes the 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) Russian 6x6 Amphibious Short-Range Tactical Surface-to-Air Missile System.

Hezbollah Proliferation. The 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) Russian 6x6 Amphibious Short-Range Tactical Surface-to-Air Missile System is a Russian-made highly mobile, low-altitude, short-range tactical surface-to-air missile system. "9K33" is its GRAU designation. The development program was protracted with major redesigns of both the missile and launch platform required. Extensive range testing of the Osa for the Land Forces was conducted at a test range in Kazakhstan in 1965 where many of the faults of the original system were discovered. The modified system was named Osa-M with most of the individual systems having to be redesigned and also many of the developing agencies changed. The Russian Army accepted the OSA-M for service in 1972. Series production of the system began in 1971. The SA-8 Gecko is intended for the defense on troops on the march and in mobile combat, as well as of strategic ground facilities against airstrikes delivered by manned or unmanned air vehicles flying at low and medium altitudes. All versions of the SA-8 Gecko feature an all-in-one 9A33 transporter erector launcher and radar(TELAR) vehicles which can detect, track and engage aircraft independently or with the aid of regimental surveillance radars.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cuba, Ecuador, Georgia, Greece, India, Jordan, Libya, Non-State Actors, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine.
