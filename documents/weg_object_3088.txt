This document describes the T-64BV Ukrainian Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The T-64BV is a T-64B upgraded with ERA added to the hull and turret. The T-64BV can be differentiated from the T-64B by the large quantity of ERA added to the turret and hull. T-64BV may appear similar to a T-72 once up-armored. The two may be separated either by the way that the ERA is added to the turret, which on the T-72 may simply consist of ERA tiles added flat to the turret instead of in an arrowhead shape. Alternatively, T-72s with arrow-shaped ERA on the turret front will often carry much larger ERA tiles that leave gaps between each section of armor.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Ukraine.
