This document describes the S-300PMU-2 Favourite (SA-20B) Russian Long-Range Air Defense Missile System.

The S-300PMU-2 or Favorit air defense missile system was developed especially for export. It evolved from the S-300PM-2, which was developed for the Russian Armed Forces. The S-300PMU-2 has the highest capabilities in the S-300P family. It was introduced in 1997. As of 2016, this system is 19 years old. The S-300PMU-2 is referred in the West as SA-20B Gargoyle. It uses a 30N6E1 (Tomb Stone) radar. This radar has a range of 300 km, can detect 100 targets, track and engage 36 of them and guide 72 missiles. It is worth noting that earlier radars of the S-300 family could simultaneously engage only 6 targets and guide 12 missiles.

   Unlike the previous S-300PMU-1, the S-300PMU-2 doesn't use the 36D6 (Tin Shield) and 76N6 (Clam Shell) radars. Instead, the system uses 96L6 all-altitude detector and acquisition radar. The 96L6 works in L-band. It has a 300 km range and very high resolution. The system can detect and track 100 targets. It identifies 4 target classes, including aircraft, helicopters, remotely piloted aerial vehicles, and missiles. It is claimed that this radar can also detect stealthy targets.

The S-300PMU2 Favorit system is comprised of:

* 83M6E2 command post (CP)
* up to six 90Zh6E2 air defense missile complexes
* 48N6E2 air defense missiles
* technical support facilities.

  A battery of the S-300PMU-2 also includes the 30N6E2 X-band engagement radar, the 96L6E L-band acquisition radar, eight (maximum of twelve are supported ) 5P58TE/SE or 5T58-2 TELs with missiles a 54K6E2 or 55K6E command post, and a 22T6E2 missile loader. Also, battalions use one or two  64N6E2 S-band radars.

This equipment has proliferated into the following countries: Algeria, Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Egypt, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kazakhstan, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Slovakia, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam.
