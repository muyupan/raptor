This document describes the DZ-9300 Chinese Man-Portable Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) System.

The Chinese DZ-9300 is a man-portable ELINT System developed by China Electronics Technology Corporation (CETC). The system is designed to detect, intercept, analyze, identify, and record enemy land-based, airborne, and shipborne radar radiation. Once the enemy emitter signal profile (technical parameters and operation modes) have been collected and analyzed, operations personnel can begin the planning of defensive and offensive countermeasures to degrade or defeat the respective enemy communications and non-communication emitter. 

The DZ-9300 consist of two components or sub-systems: DZ-9300A (50-250 MHz) and DZ-9300B (250-1000 MHz).
